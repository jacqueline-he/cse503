You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to caluclate area of a parallelogram.
Required function signature:
def parallelogram_area(b,h):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure it's a single function that takes no arguments.

```python
def parallelogram_area(b,h):
```

```python
    # Define variables
    area = 0
    # Calculate area using the formula A = 2 * b * h
    area = 2 * b * h
    return area
```

```python
# Edge case: b or h is negative
def parallelogram_area(b,h):
    # Check if either b or h is negative
    if b < 0 or h < 0:
        raise ValueError("Both b and h must be non-negative")
    # Calculate area
    area = 2 * b * h
    return area
```

```python
# Test the function
print(parallelogram_area(5, 10))  # Expected output: 100
print(parallelogram_area(-3, 5))  # Expected output: ValueError
```

```python
# This code is not necessary, it was used to test the function
# We will remove it as it's not necessary for the solution
# We will use the function instead
```assistant

```python
def parallelogram_area(b, h):
    # Define variables
    area = 0
    
    # Calculate area using the formula A = 2 * b * h
    area = 2 * b * h
    
    # Check if either b or h is negative
    if b < 0 or h < 0:
        raise ValueError("Both b and h must be non-negative")
    
    # Return the calculated area
    return area
```

```python
# Edge case: b or h is negative
def parallelogram_area(b, h):
    # Check if either b or h is negative
    if b < 0 or h < 0:
        raise ValueError("Both b and h must be non-negative")
    # Calculate area
    area = 2 * b * h
    return area
```

```python
# Test the function
print(parallelogram_area(5, 10))  # Expected output: 100
print(parallelogram_area(-3, 5))  # Expected output: ValueError
```
