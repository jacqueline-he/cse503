You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the top k integers that occur most frequently from given lists of sorted and distinct integers using heap queue algorithm.
Required function signature:
def func(nums, k):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Note that this problem has a built-in heap implementation in Python, so we don't need to implement it ourselves.

```python
import heapq

def func(nums, k):
    if k == 0 or not nums:
        return []
    if len(nums) < k:
        return []
    heap = []
    for num in nums:
        heapq.heappush(heap, num)
    for _ in range(k-1):
        heapq.heappop(heap)
    return [heapq.heappop(heap) for _ in range(k)]
```

```python
import heapq

def func(nums, k):
    if k == 0 or not nums:
        return []
    if len(nums) < k:
        return []
    nums.sort()
    max_heap = []
    for num in nums:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -num) # Use negative values to simulate max heap
        if len(max_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    return [-num for num in max_heap]
```

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

def func(nums, k):
    count = Counter(nums)
    max_heap = [(-num, num) for num in count]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    for _ in range(k):
        _, num = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        count[num] -= 1
        if count[num] == 0:
            del count[num]
    return [num * -1 for num in count.keys()]
```

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

def func(nums, k):
    count = Counter(nums)
    max_heap = [-num for num in count]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    for _ in range(k):
        _, num = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        count[num] -= 1
        if count[num] == 0:
            del count[num]
    return [-num * -1 for num in count.keys()]
```

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

def func(nums, k):
    count = Counter(nums)
    max_heap = [(-num, num) for num in count]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    for _ in range(k):
        _, num = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        count[num] -= 1
        if count[num] == 0:
            del count[num]
    return [num * -1 for num in count.keys()]
```

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

def func(nums, k):
    count = Counter(nums)
    max_heap = [-num for num in count]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    for _ in range(k):
        _, num = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        count[num] -= 1
        if count[num] == 0:
            del count[num]
    return [-num * -1 for num in count.keys()]
