You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to set all odd bits of a given number.
Required function signature:
def odd_bit_set_number(n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure it's correct and handles all test cases.

```python
def odd_bit_set_number(n):
    return 0 if n == 0 else (n & 1) if n & 1 else ((n & 1) << 1) | ((n >> 1) & 1)
```
## Step 1: Analyze the problem
The problem asks us to write a function that sets all odd bits of a given number.

## Step 2: Outline the key steps
1. Check if the input number is 0, in which case we return 0.
2. If the input number is not 0, we use bitwise AND (&) to check if the least significant bit (LSB) is 1.
3. If the LSB is 1, we set the corresponding bit to 1 by performing a bitwise left shift (<<) and then a bitwise OR operation with the bitwise complement of the LSB.

## Step 3: Implement the solution
```python
def odd_bit_set_number(n):
    # Check if the input number is 0
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Use bitwise AND to check if the LSB is 1
    if n & 1:
        # If the LSB is 1, set the corresponding bit to 1
        return (n & 1) << 1 | ((n >> 1) & 1)

    # If the LSB is 0, return the original number
    return n
```
The final answer is:
```python
def odd_bit_set_number(n):
    # Check if the input number is 0
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Use bitwise AND to check if the LSB is 1
    if n & 1:
        # If the LSB is 1, set the corresponding bit to 1
        return (n & 1) << 1 | ((n >> 1) & 1)

    # If the LSB is 0, return the original number
    return n
```
