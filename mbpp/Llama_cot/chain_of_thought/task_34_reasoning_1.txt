You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to find the missing number in a sorted array.
Required function signature:
def find_missing(ar,N):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I don't want any extra text.

```python
def find_missing(ar,N):
```

```python
# Edge case: When N is 0 or 1, the function should return 0 or 1 respectively.
if N == 0 or N == 1:
    return 0
```

```python
# Edge case: When the array has only 1 element, the function should return the missing number.
if N == 1:
    return ar[0]
```

```python
# Sort the array
ar.sort()
```

```python
# Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array
left = 0
right = N - 1
```

```python
# Loop until the two pointers meet
while left < right:
    # Calculate the sum of the elements at the two pointers
    total = ar[left] + ar[right]
    # If the sum is equal to N, the missing number is N - 1
    if total == N:
        return N - 1
    # If the sum is less than N, move the left pointer to the right
    elif total < N:
        left += 1
    # If the sum is greater than N, move the right pointer to the left
    else:
        right -= 1
```

```python
def find_missing(ar, N):
```

```python
# Sort the array
ar.sort()

# Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array
left = 0
right = N - 1

# Loop until the two pointers meet
while left < right:
    # Calculate the sum of the elements at the two pointers
    total = ar[left] + ar[right]
    # If the sum is equal to N, the missing number is N - 1
    if total == N:
        return N - 1
    # If the sum is less than N, move the left pointer to the right
    elif total < N:
        left += 1
    # If the sum is greater than N, move the right pointer to the left
    else:
        right -= 1
```
