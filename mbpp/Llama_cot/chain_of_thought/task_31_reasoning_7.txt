You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the top k integers that occur most frequently from given lists of sorted and distinct integers using heap queue algorithm.
Required function signature:
def func(nums, k):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Since the problem requires finding the top k integers that occur most frequently, we will use a heap queue algorithm.

**Step 1: Analyze the problem**
The task is to find the top k integers that occur most frequently from given lists of sorted and distinct integers. This means we need to find the k most frequent numbers in each list and then combine them.

**Step 2: Key steps and algorithms**
To solve this problem, we will use a heap queue algorithm. We will first count the frequency of each number in each list, then build a heap from these frequency counts. Finally, we will extract the k most frequent numbers from the heap.

**Step 3: Edge cases**
We need to consider edge cases such as:
- If the input lists are empty, we should return an empty list.
- If the input lists have less than k distinct integers, we should return an empty list.
- If the input lists are not sorted, we should return an empty list.

**Step 4: Implement the solution**
Here is the implementation of the solution in a single code block:
```python
import heapq
import collections

def func(nums, k):
    # Count frequency of each number in each list
    freq = collections.defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1

    # Build a heap from frequency counts
    heap = [(-freq, num) for num, freq in freq.items()]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    # Extract the k most frequent numbers
    result = []
    for _ in range(k):
        _, num = heapq.heappop(heap)
        result.append(num)

    return result
```
