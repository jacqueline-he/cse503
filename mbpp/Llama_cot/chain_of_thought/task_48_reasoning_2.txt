You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to set all odd bits of a given number.
Required function signature:
def odd_bit_set_number(n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 
```python
def odd_bit_set_number(n):
    # Convert the number to binary
    bin_n = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Iterate through each bit in the binary representation
    for i in range(len(bin_n)):
        # Check if the bit is odd (i.e., the count of '1's is odd)
        if bin_n[i] == '1' and bin_n[i+1] == '1':
            # Set the odd bit to '1' in the original number
            bin_n = bin_n[:i] + '1' + bin_n[i+2:]
    
    return int(bin_n, 2)
```
```python
# Test the function
print(odd_bit_set_number(10))  # Expected output: 11
print(odd_bit_set_number(20))  # Expected output: 21
print(odd_bit_set_number(30))  # Expected output: 31
```
```python
# Edge case: 0
print(odd_bit_set_number(0))  # Expected output: 0
```
