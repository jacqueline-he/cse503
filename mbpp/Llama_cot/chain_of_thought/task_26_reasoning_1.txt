You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to check if the given tuple list has all k elements.
Required function signature:
def check_k_elements(test_list, K):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def check_k_elements(test_list, K):
    """
    This function checks if a given list has all k elements.

    Args:
    test_list (list): A list of elements to be checked.
    K (int): The number of elements to be checked.

    Returns:
    bool: True if all k elements are present, False otherwise.
    """
```

Step 1: Analyzing the problem
The problem is asking to check if a given tuple list has all k elements. This means we need to check if all k elements in the list are present.

Step 2: Key steps or algorithms needed
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of sets. We can convert each tuple in the list to a set and then check if the length of the set is equal to k.

Step 3: Edge cases to consider
We need to consider the case where the list is empty and the case where k is greater than the number of elements in the list.

Step 4: Implementing the solution
```python
def check_k_elements(test_list, K):
    """
    This function checks if a given list has all k elements.

    Args:
    test_list (list): A list of elements to be checked.
    K (int): The number of elements to be checked.

    Returns:
    bool: True if all k elements are present, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not test_list:
        return False

    # Convert each tuple to a set and check if the length is equal to K
    return len(set(tuple(x) for x in test_list)) == K
```
Note: We use tuple(x) to convert each element in the tuple to a set because sets automatically eliminate duplicates. We also use a generator expression to convert each tuple to a set, which is more efficient than creating a list of sets.
