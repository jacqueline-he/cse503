You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the perimeter of a square.
Required function signature:
def square_perimeter(a):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I'll provide the input data.

```python
def square_perimeter(a):
```

```python
import math
```

```python
# Define the function
def square_perimeter(a):
```

```python
    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = 4 * a
```

```python
    # Return the result
    return perimeter
```

```python
# Test the function
a = 5
print(square_perimeter(a))
```

Please go ahead and implement the function using the EXACT function signature. I will then review and provide feedback.
