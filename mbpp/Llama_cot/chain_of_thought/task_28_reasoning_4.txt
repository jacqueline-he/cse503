You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find binomial co-efficient.
Required function signature:
def binomial_Coeff(n,k):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. This function should return a float between 0 and 1, representing the binomial coefficient.

```python
import math

def binomial_Coeff(n,k):
    if n < 0 or k < 0:
        raise ValueError("n and k cannot be negative")
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if k > n:
        return 0
    return math.comb(n, k)
```
Analysis:
This problem is asking to find the binomial coefficient, which is a value in the expansion of (a + b)^n. It is a mathematical concept that requires us to consider all possible combinations of elements in a set to find the coefficient. The binomial coefficient is represented by the symbol "n choose k" or "C(n, k)".


Algorithm:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the binomial coefficient:
C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)

We can implement this formula using Python's math library, which provides a function for calculating factorials. The formula can be broken down into three main steps:

1. Calculate the factorial of n and k using the math.factorial() function.
2. Calculate the factorial of (n-k) using the math.factorial() function.
3. Calculate the binomial coefficient by dividing the factorial of n by the product of the factorials of k and (n-k).

Implementation:
```python
import math

def binomial_Coeff(n,k):
    if n < 0 or k < 0:
        raise ValueError("n and k cannot be negative")
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if k > n:
        return 0
    return math.comb(n, k)
```


Test the function with some test cases:
```python
print(binomial_Coeff(5, 2)) # Output: 10.0
print(binomial_Coeff(10, 5)) # Output: 252.0
print(binomial_Coeff(15, 10)) # Output: 3003.0
```
