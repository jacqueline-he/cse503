You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the nth digit in the proper fraction of two given numbers.
Required function signature:


Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Note: We will assume that the input will be two integers representing the two numbers.

```python
def nth_digit_proper_fraction(num1, num2):
    """
    Returns the nth digit in the proper fraction of two given numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The nth digit in the proper fraction of two given numbers.
    """
```

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the nth digit in the proper fraction of two given numbers. A proper fraction is a fraction where the numerator is less than the denominator.

## Step 2: Identify Key Steps or Algorithms
To find the nth digit in the proper fraction, we can first convert the two numbers to their decimal representations, then find the nth digit in the decimal representation of the proper fraction.

## Step 3: Consider Edge Cases
We should consider the case when the input numbers are 0, as the proper fraction of 0 is undefined. We should also consider the case when one of the input numbers is 0, as the proper fraction of 0 is undefined.

## Step 4: Implement the Solution
We will use the following steps to implement the solution:

1. Convert the two numbers to their decimal representations.
2. Find the numerator and denominator of the proper fraction.
3. Find the nth digit in the decimal representation of the proper fraction.

```python
def nth_digit_proper_fraction(num1, num2):
    """
    Returns the nth digit in the proper fraction of two given numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The nth digit in the proper fraction of two given numbers.
    """
    # Check for edge cases
    if num1 == 0 or num2 == 0:
        raise ValueError("Both numbers must be non-zero")

    # Convert the two numbers to their decimal representations
    decimal1 = num1 / num2
    decimal2 = num2 / num1

    # Find the numerator and denominator of the proper fraction
    numerator = int(decimal1 * 10**len(str(decimal1)) - 1)
    denominator = 10**len(str(decimal1))

    # Find the nth digit in the decimal representation of the proper fraction
    nth_digit = int((numerator / denominator) * 10**len(str(decimal1)) + decimal1 % 1)

    return nth_digit
```
