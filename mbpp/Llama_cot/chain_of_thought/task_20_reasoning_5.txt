You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not.
Required function signature:
def is_woodall(x):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure it is correct and handles all test cases.

```python
def is_woodall(x):
    return 'woodball' if x % 3 == 0 else 'not woodball'
```

## Step 1: Analyzing the problem
This problem is asking for a function that determines whether a given number is "woodball" or not. To solve this, we need to understand the properties of a woodball.

## Step 2: Key steps and algorithms
1. We can use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 3. If the remainder is 0, the number is divisible by 3.
2. We can use a simple if-else statement to return "woodball" if the number is divisible by 3 and "not woodball" otherwise.

## Step 3: Edge cases to consider
1. What if the input is a negative number? Should it return "woodball" or "not woodball"? We can add a check to handle this case.
2. What if the input is 0? Should it return "woodball" or "not woodball"? We can add another check to handle this case.

## Step 4: Implementing the solution
Here's the complete solution inside triple backticks:
```python
def is_woodall(x):
    if x < 0:
        return 'not woodball'
    elif x == 0:
        return 'woodball'
    else:
        return 'woodball' if x % 3 == 0 else 'not woodball'
```
