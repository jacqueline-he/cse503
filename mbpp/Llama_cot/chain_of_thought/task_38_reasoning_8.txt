You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the division of first even and odd number of a given list.
Required function signature:
def div_even_odd(list1):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure the function name is exactly as specified.

```python
def div_even_odd(list1):
```

```python
# Step 1: Initialize variables to keep track of the count of even and odd numbers
even_count = 0
odd_count = 0
```

```python
# Step 2: Iterate over each number in the list
for num in list1:
    # Step 3: Check if the number is even or odd
    if num % 2 == 0:
        # Step 4: Increment the even count
        even_count += 1
    else:
        # Step 5: Increment the odd count
        odd_count += 1

```python
# Step 6: Return the division of even count by odd count
return even_count / odd_count
```

```python
# Example usage:
numbers = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
