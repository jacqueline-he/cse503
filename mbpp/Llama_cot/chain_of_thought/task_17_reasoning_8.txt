You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to find the perimeter of a square.
Required function signature:
def square_perimeter(a):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Since this is a mathematical problem, I will use algebra to solve it.

Step 1: Define the variables and the function signature.
Let's define the variables:
- `a`: the side length of the square
- `P`: the perimeter of the square
- `s`: the side length of the square (which we are trying to find)

Step 2: Write the equation for the perimeter of the square.
The perimeter of a square is given by:
`P = 4s`

Step 3: Write the equation for the side length `s` in terms of `a`.
Since `s` is the side length of the square, we can write:
`s = a`

Step 4: Implement the solution using algebra.
We want to find the perimeter `P` of the square. Using the equation `P = 4s`, we can substitute `s` with `a`:
`P = 4a`

Step 5: Simplify the solution.
There is no need to simplify the solution as it is already in its simplest form.

Here is the complete solution inside triple backticks:
```python
def square_perimeter(a):
    s = a
    P = 4 * s
    return P
```
