You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Required function signature:


Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will test it on multiple test cases.


```python
def find_volume_of_triangular_prism(length, width, height):
    # step 1: Define the function to calculate the volume
    def calculate_volume(length, width, height):
        # step 2: Define the formula for the volume
        # The volume of a triangular prism is calculated as the area of the base (a triangle) times the height
        base_area = 0.5 * length * width
        volume = base_area * height
        return volume

    # step 3: Calculate and return the volume
    return calculate_volume(length, width, height)
