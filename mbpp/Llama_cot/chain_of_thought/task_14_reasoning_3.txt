You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Required function signature:


Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I want to make sure my code is correct and efficient. I don't want to use input() function or any external libraries.

```python
def volume_of_prism():
    pass
```

```python
def calculate_volume():
    # Step 1: Define the variables
    a = 5  # length of the base
    b = 3  # width of the base
    h = 4  # height of the prism

    # Step 2: Calculate the area of the base
    area_base = 0.5 * b * a

    # Step 3: Calculate the volume of the prism
    volume_prism = area_base * h

    # Step 4: Return the volume
    return volume_prism

# Step 5: Test the function
print(calculate_volume())
```

```python
def calculate_volume():
    # Step 1: Define the variables
    a = 5  # length of the base
    b = 3  # width of the base
    h = 4  # height of the prism

    # Step 2: Calculate the area of the base
    area_base = 0.5 * b * a

    # Step 3: Calculate the volume of the prism
    volume_prism = area_base * h

    # Step 4: Return the volume
    return volume_prism

# Step 5: Test the function
print(calculate_volume())
