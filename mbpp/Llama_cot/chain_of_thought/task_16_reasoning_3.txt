You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore.
Required function signature:
def text_lowercase_underscore(text):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will provide the input text.

```python
def text_lowercase_underscore(text):
    """
    This function takes a string as an input and returns a string where 
    each character in the input string is joined with an underscore.

    Parameters:
    text (str): The input string

    Returns:
    str: The string with each character joined with an underscore
    """
    return '_'.join(text)
```
Please note that I am going to test the function with the following inputs:
```python
print(text_lowercase_underscore('ab'))  # Expected output: ab
print(text_lowercase_underscore('abc'))  # Expected output: abc
print(text_lowercase_underscore('xyz'))  # Expected output: xyz
print(text_lowercase_underscore('abc_abc'))  # Expected output: abc_abc
````
Please provide the solution. I am looking forward to your response.
