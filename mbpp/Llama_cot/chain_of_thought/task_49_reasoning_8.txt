You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to extract every first or specified element from a given two-dimensional list.
Required function signature:
def specified_element(nums, N):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Note that this function should return a list of elements.

```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
```

```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
    """
    This function takes a two-dimensional list of numbers and an integer N as parameters.
    It returns a list of elements from the first or specified position.
    
    Parameters:
    nums (list): A two-dimensional list of numbers.
    N (int): The position from which to extract elements.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of elements from the first or specified position.
    """

    # Step 1: Check if the input list is empty
    if not nums:
        return []
    
    # Step 2: Get the first element of the list
    first_element = nums[0]
    
    # Step 3: Check if N is greater than the length of the list
    if N > len(nums):
        return []
    
    # Step 4: Check if N is less than 0
    if N < 0:
        return []
    
    # Step 5: If all checks pass, return the first N elements
    return [first_element] * N

```python
# Example usage
nums = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
N = 1
result = specified_element(nums, N)
print(result)  # Output: [1]
```

```python
# Example usage

N = 2
result = specified_element(nums, N)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2]
