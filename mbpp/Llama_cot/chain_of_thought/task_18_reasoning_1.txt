You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
Required function signature:
def str_to_list(string):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I'll provide the input data.

def str_to_list(string):
```

```python
def str_to_list(string):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the characters that are not present in the second string
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the first string
    for char in string:
        # Check if the character is not present in the second string
        if char not in string2:
            # Append the character to the result list
            result.append(char)
    
    # Return the result list
