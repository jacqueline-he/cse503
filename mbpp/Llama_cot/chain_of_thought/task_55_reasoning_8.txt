You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to find t-nth term of geometric series.
Required function signature:
def tn_gp(a,n,r):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Don't forget to use the EXACT function signature.

```python
def tn_gp(a, n, r):
    if r < 0:
        return "Invalid input"
    elif n == 0:
        return "Invalid input"
    else:
        return EXACT(a, n, r)
```
## Step 1: Define the problem
The problem is to find the t-nth term of a geometric series. A geometric series is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio (r).

## Step 2: Determine the key steps or algorithms needed
To find the t-nth term of a geometric series, we need to use the formula:
an = ar^(t-1)

Where:
- an is the t-nth term
- a is the first term
- r is the common ratio
- t is the term number (starting from 1)

## Step 3: Identify edge cases
There are no edge cases in this problem.

## Step 4: Implement the solution
```python
def tn_gp(a, n, r):
    if r < 0:
        return "Invalid input"
    elif n == 0:
        return "Invalid input"
    else:
        return EXACT(a, n, r)
````
Note: The EXACT function is used to return the result exactly, without approximation. If the input values are invalid, the function will return an error message.
