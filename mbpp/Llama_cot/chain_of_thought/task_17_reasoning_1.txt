You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the perimeter of a square.
Required function signature:
def square_perimeter(a):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. This is the final step.

```python
def square_perimeter(a):
```

```python
import math
```

```python
def square_perimeter(a):
    """
    Calculate the perimeter of a square.

    The perimeter of a square is the distance around the square.
    It is equal to 4 times the length of one side.

    Args:
        a (float): The length of one side of the square.

    Returns:
        float: The perimeter of the square.
    """
    # Step 1: Calculate the length of one side of the square
    side_length = math.sqrt(a)

    # Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the square
    perimeter = 4 * side_length

    return perimeter
```

```python
# Example usage:
side_length = 5
perimeter = square_perimeter(side_length)
print(f"The perimeter of the square with side length {side_length} is {perimeter}")
```

```python
# Edge case: Side length is zero
side_length = 0
perimeter = square_perimeter(side_length)
print(f"The perimeter of the square with side length {side_length} is {perimeter}")
```

```python
# Edge case: Side length is negative
side_length = -5
perimeter = square_perimeter(side_length)
print(f"The perimeter of the square with side length {side_length} is {perimeter}")
```

```python
# Edge case: Side length is a non-numeric value
try:
    side_length = "five"
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Side length must be a number.")
```

```python
# Example usage:
side_length = 5
perimeter = square_perimeter(side_length)
print(f"The perimeter of the square with side length {side_length} is {perimeter}")
