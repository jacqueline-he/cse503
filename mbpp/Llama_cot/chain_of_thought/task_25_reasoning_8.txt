You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to find the product of non-repeated elements in a given array.
Required function signature:
def find_Product(arr,n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will use this as a reference for your answer.

This problem is asking to find the product of non-repeated elements in a given array.
The product of non-repeated elements can be calculated using the formula: product = n! / (n1! * n2! *... nk!)
where n is the total number of elements and n1, n2,... nk are the number of occurrences of each unique element.

Here's the reasoning behind the algorithm:

1. First, we calculate the total number of elements (n) using the built-in len() function.
2. Then, we create a dictionary (freq) to store the count of each unique element.
3. We iterate through the array and for each element, we increment its count in the freq dictionary.
4. Finally, we calculate the product of all elements using the formula: product = n! / (n1! * n2! *... nk!).

Here's the implementation:

```python
import math

def find_product(arr, n):
    product = 1
    freq = {}
    for i in range(n):
        product *= arr[i]
        if arr[i] in freq:
            freq[arr[i]] += 1
        else:
            freq[arr[i]] = 1
    product *= math.factorial(n) // math.factorial(freq[1])
    return product
```


This is the final implementation of the function. It calculates the product of non-repeated elements in the array using the formula: product = n! / (n1! * n2! *... nk!). The function takes two parameters: the array and the total number of elements. It returns the product of all non-repeated elements in the array.
