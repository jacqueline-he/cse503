You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the product of non-repeated elements in a given array.
Required function signature:
def find_Product(arr,n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Here's the explanation for each step.

```python
def find_Product(arr,n):
```

```python
# Step 1: Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element in the array.
freq_dict = {}

# Step 2: Iterate through the array and count the frequency of each element.
for i in range(n):
    if i not in freq_dict:
        freq_dict[i] = 1
    else:
        freq_dict[i] += 1

# Step 3: Initialize the product variable to 1.
product = 1

# Step 4: Iterate through the dictionary and calculate the product of non-repeated elements.
for key, value in freq_dict.items():
    if value == 1:
        product *= key

# Step 5: Return the product of non-repeated elements.
return product
```

```python
def find_Product(arr, n):
```

```python
# Step 1: Check if the array is empty or has less than two elements.
if len(arr) < 2:
    return 1

# Step 2: Check if the array contains duplicate elements.
if len(set(arr))!= len(arr):
    return 0

# Step 3: Initialize the product variable to 1.
product = 1

# Step 4: Iterate through the array and calculate the product of non-repeated elements.
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if i not in set(arr):
        product *= arr[i]

# Step 5: Return the product of non-repeated elements.
return product
```

```python
