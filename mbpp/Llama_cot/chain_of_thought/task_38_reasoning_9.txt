You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the division of first even and odd number of a given list.
Required function signature:
def div_even_odd(list1):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. This will be the final answer. Do not include any comments or explanations outside the triple backticks. ```python
def div_even_odd(lst):
    sum_even_odd = 0
    for i in lst:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum_even_odd += i
        else:
            sum_even_odd -= i
    return sum_even_odd
```

```python
def div_even_odd(lst):
    sum_even_odd = 0
    for i in lst:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum_even_odd += i
        else:
            sum_even_odd -= i
    return sum_even_odd
```
