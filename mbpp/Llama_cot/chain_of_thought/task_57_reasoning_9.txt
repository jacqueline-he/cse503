You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given digits.
Required function signature:


Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure it's readable and well-documented.

```python
def largest_number(digits):
    if not digits:
        return '0'
    largest = digits[0]
    for digit in digits:
        if digit > largest:
            largest = digit
    return ''.join(sorted(largest + ''.join(reversed(digits)), key=len))
```
Analysis:
This problem is asking to find the largest number that can be formed with the given digits. We need to compare each digit with the largest so far and replace it with the larger one. The result is then sorted by the length of the resulting number.

Step 1: Determine the approach and key steps.
Step 2: Identify any edge cases to consider.
Step 3: Outline the solution.

```python
def largest_number(digits):
    """
    This function takes a list of digits as input and returns the largest number that can be formed.
    
    Parameters:
    digits (list): A list of digits.
    
    Returns:
    str: The largest number that can be formed with the given digits.
    """
    
    # Handle edge cases where the input list is empty
    if not digits:
        return '0'
    
    # Initialize the largest number with the first digit
    largest = digits[0]
    
    # Compare each digit with the largest so far and replace it with the larger one
    for digit in digits:
        if digit > largest:
            largest = digit
    
    # Sort the largest number by the length of the resulting number
    sorted_largest = ''.join(sorted(largest + ''.join(reversed(digits)), key=len))
    
    # Return the largest number
    return sorted_largest
