You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to remove all digits from a list of strings.
Required function signature:
def remove(list):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. ```python
def remove(lst):
    return [i for i in lst if not i.isdigit()]
```



Here's my reasoning and solution:
This problem asks to remove all digits from a list of strings. We can solve this problem by iterating over each string in the list and checking if it contains any digits. If it does, we skip it. If it doesn't, we include it in the new list.

Key steps:
- Create an empty list to store the non-digit strings
- Iterate over each string in the input list
- Check if the string contains any digits using the `isdigit()` method
- If it doesn't, add the string to the new list

Edge cases:
- The input list might be empty
- The input list might contain only non-digit strings
- The input list might contain only digit strings

Implementation:
```python
def remove(lst):
    return [i for i in lst if not i.isdigit()]
```
