You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to set all odd bits of a given number.
Required function signature:
def odd_bit_set_number(n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks.```python
def odd_bit_set_number(n):
    """Set all odd bits of a given number."""
    result = 0
    while n > 0:
        # Extract the least significant bit
        bit = n & 1
        # If the bit is odd, set it to 1
        if bit % 2 == 1:
            result |= 1 << bit
        # Right shift the number to remove the bit
        n >>= 1
    return result
```

Step 1: Analyze the problem
The task is to set all odd bits of a given number. An odd bit is a bit that is 1 in binary representation.

Step 2: Identify the key steps or algorithms needed
To solve this problem, we need to implement a loop that iterates through each bit of the given number, extracts the least significant bit, and sets it to 1 if it's odd. We also need to use bitwise operations to remove the extracted bit from the number.

Step 3: Identify any edge cases to consider
No edge cases are mentioned in the problem statement. Therefore, we can assume that the input will always be a positive integer.

Step 4: Implement the complete solution inside triple backticks.
