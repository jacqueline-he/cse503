You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to print check if the triangle is equilateral or not.
Required function signature:
def check_equilateral(x,y,z):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I am looking for a function that returns a boolean value.

```python
def check_equilateral(x,y,z):
```

```python
# step 1:  Analyze the problem to understand what it is asking
# This is a basic geometry problem, where we need to check if a given triangle is equilateral
# A triangle is equilateral if all its sides are equal
```

```python
# step 2:  Identify the key steps or algorithms needed
# To determine if a triangle is equilateral, we can calculate the lengths of its sides using the distance formula
# We will store the side lengths in variables x, y, z
# Then, we will check if the three side lengths are equal
```

```python
# step 3:  Consider edge cases to ensure the function works correctly
# No specific edge cases mentioned, but we should consider cases where the input values are invalid
# For example, if x, y, z are all zero, the function should return False
```

```python
# step 4:  Implement the solution using the identified key steps
# Calculate the side lengths using the distance formula
side_length_x = math.sqrt((x - 0) ** 2 + (y - 0) ** 2)
side_length_y = math.sqrt((x - 0) ** 2 + (y - 0) ** 2)
side_length_z = math.sqrt((x - 0) ** 2 + (y - 0) ** 2)

# Check if the three side lengths are equal
if side_length_x == side_length_y == side_length_z:
    return True
else:
    return False
```

```python
import math

def check_equilateral(x,y,z):
```

```python
# This function should return a boolean value indicating whether the triangle is equilateral or not
```

```python
# First, we need to import the math module to use the sqrt function
# We will use this function to calculate the side lengths of the triangle
```

```python
# Define the function check_equilateral
def check_equilateral(x,y,z):
    # Calculate the side lengths of the triangle
    side_length_x = math.sqrt((x - 0) ** 2 + (y - 0) ** 2)
    side_length_y = math.sqrt((x - 0) ** 2 + (y - 0) ** 2)
    side_length_z = math.sqrt((x - 0) ** 2 + (y - 0) ** 2)
    
    # Check if the three side lengths are equal
    if side_length_x == side_length_y == side_length_z:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

```python
# Now, we can return the result of the check_equilateral function
# This will be a boolean value indicating whether the triangle is equilateral or not
```

```python
# Finally, we can call the check_equilateral function with example values for x, y, and z
# For example, let's say we have a triangle with side lengths of 3, 4, and 5
# We can call the check_equilateral function like this:
print(check_equilateral(3,4,5))  # Output: True
```assistant

import math

def check_equilateral(x,y,z):
    # First, we need to calculate the side lengths of the triangle
    side_length_x = math.sqrt((x - 0) ** 2 + (y - 0) ** 2)
    side_length_y = math.sqrt((x - 0) ** 2 + (y - 0) ** 2)
    side_length_z = math.sqrt((x - 0) ** 2 + (y - 0) ** 2)

    # Check if the three side lengths are equal
    if side_length_x == side_length_y == side_length_z:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Now, we can return the result of the check_equilateral function
# This will be a boolean value indicating whether the triangle is equilateral or not
print(check_equilateral(3,4,5))  # Output: Trueassistant
