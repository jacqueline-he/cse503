You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the largest prime factor of a given number.
Required function signature:
def max_Prime_Factors(n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. ```python
def max_Prime_Factors(n):
    # Step 1: Define a helper function to check if a number is prime
    def is_prime(num):
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    # Step 2: Initialize an empty list to store prime factors
    prime_factors = []

    # Step 3: Iterate through numbers from 2 to n (inclusive)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Step 4: Check if i is a prime number
        if is_prime(i):
            # Step 5: If i is prime, add it to the list of prime factors
            prime_factors.append(i)

    # Step 6: Find the largest prime factor
    max_prime_factor = max(prime_factors)

    return max_prime_factor
```ï¿½  The function `max_Prime_Factors` takes a number `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of that number.
