You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
Required function signature:
def str_to_list(string):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure to include the EXACT function signature and input/output handling.

```python
def str_to_list(string):
```

```python
def str_to_list(string):
```

```python
def str_to_list(string):
```

```python
def str_to_list(string):
```

Step 1: Define a function `str_to_list` that takes a string as input and returns a list of characters that are present in the string but not in the second string.

Step 2: Create a set of characters in the second string for efficient lookups.

```python
second_string_set = set(string)
```

Step 3: Iterate over each character in the first string and check if it's present in the set of characters in the second string.

```python
result = [char for char in string if char not in second_string_set]
```

Step 4: Return the resulting list.

```python
return result
```

```python
def str_to_list(string):
    second_string_set = set(string)
    result = [char for char in string if char not in second_string_set]
    return result
```

```python
def str_to_list(string):
    second_string_set = set(string)
    result = [char for char in string if char not in second_string_set]
    return result
```

```python
def str_to_list(string):
    second_string_set = set(string)
    result = [char for char in string if char not in second_string_set]
    return result
