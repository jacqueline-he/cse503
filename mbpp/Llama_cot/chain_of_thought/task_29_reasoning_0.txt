You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to find the element occurring odd number of times.
Required function signature:
def get_Odd_Occurrence(arr,arr_size):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 
```
def get_Odd_Occurrence(arr, arr_size):
    # Step 1: Initialize variables to keep track of the occurrence of each element
    count_dict = {}
    # Step 2: Iterate over the array to count the occurrence of each element
    for i in range(arr_size):
        if arr[i] in count_dict:
            count_dict[arr[i]] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[arr[i]] = 1
    # Step 3: Find the element with an odd number of occurrences
    odd_occurrence = None
    for key, value in count_dict.items():
        if value % 2!= 0:
            odd_occurrence = key
            break
    return odd_occurrence
```
Here's the solution: 
```
def get_Odd_Occurrence(arr, arr_size):
    """
    This function finds the element occurring odd number of times in the given array.

    arr (list): The input array to find the element with odd occurrences.

    Returns:
    The element with odd occurrences in the array.
