You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.
Required function signature:
def sort_matrix(M):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I'll provide the test case later.

```python
def sort_matrix(M):
    # Step 1: Calculate the total sum of all rows in the matrix
    total_sum = sum(sum(row) for row in M)
    
    # Step 2: Sort the matrix based on the total sum of its rows
    sorted_matrix = []
    for row in M:
        sorted_row = sorted(row, key=total_sum)
        sorted_matrix.append(sorted_row)
    
    return sorted_matrix
```
## Step 1: Calculate the total sum of all rows in the matrix
This involves summing up the elements of each row in the matrix. We can achieve this using a list comprehension that iterates over each row, sums its elements, and then sums up these sums to get the total sum of all rows.

## Step 2: Sort the matrix based on the total sum of its rows
To sort the matrix, we can iterate over each row, calculate the total sum of its elements, and then sort the row using the `sorted` function with a custom key function that takes into account the total sum of the row.

## Step 3: Implement the solution
```python
def sort_matrix(M):
    # Calculate the total sum of all rows in the matrix
    total_sum = sum(sum(row) for row in M)
    
    # Sort the matrix based on the total sum of its rows
    sorted_matrix = []
    for row in M:
        sorted_row = sorted(row, key=lambda x: x[total_sum])
        sorted_matrix.append(sorted_row)
    
    return sorted_matrix
````

The final answer is: 
```python
def sort_matrix(M):
    # Calculate the total sum of all rows in the matrix
    total_sum = sum(sum(row) for row in M)
    
    # Sort the matrix based on the total sum of its rows
    sorted_matrix = []
    for row in M:
        sorted_row = sorted(row, key=lambda x: x[total_sum])
        sorted_matrix.append(sorted_row)
    
    return sorted_matrix
```
