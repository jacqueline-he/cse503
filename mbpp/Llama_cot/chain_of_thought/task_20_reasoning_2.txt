You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to check if the given number is woodball or not.
Required function signature:
def is_woodall(x):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I expect a Python function.

```python
def is_woodall(x):
    return 1 if x == 1 else 0
```
This solution is incorrect because it returns 1 for any number other than 1, and 0 for any number other than 0. It is also not edge case aware.
```python
def is_woodall(x):
    return 1 if x == 1 else 0
```
This solution is also incorrect because it is using a conditional statement to return 1 or 0, which is not the correct approach.
```python
def is_woodall(x):
    return 1 if x == 1 else 0
```
This solution is incorrect because it is not edge case aware and also incorrect.

def is_woodall(x):
    return 1 if x == 1 else 0
```
