You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to sort a given mixed list of integers and strings.
Required function signature:
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will provide the test data and expected output.

```python
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):
```

```python
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):
```

```python
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):
```

```python
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):
```

```python
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):
```

### Step 1: Problem Analysis
This problem requires sorting a mixed list of integers and strings. The mixed list can contain both integers and strings, and the order of the elements in the list is not guaranteed.

### Step 2: Key Steps or Algorithms Needed
To solve this problem, we can use the built-in sorted() function in Python, which returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. We can also use the list.sort() method, which sorts the elements in place.

### Step 3: Edge Cases to Consider
One edge case to consider is when the input list is empty. We should return an empty list in this case. Another edge case is when the input list contains only one element. In this case, we should return the input list as it is already sorted.

### Step 4: Implementing the Solution
Here is the complete solution inside triple backticks:
```python
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):
    # Separate integers and strings into different lists
    integers = [x for x in mixed_list if isinstance(x, int)]
    strings = [x for x in mixed_list if isinstance(x, str)]

    # Sort integers and strings separately
    integers.sort()
    strings.sort()

    # Combine sorted integers and strings
    sorted_list = integers + strings

    return sorted_list
```assistant

def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):
    # Separate integers and strings into different lists
    integers = [x for x in mixed_list if isinstance(x, int)]
    strings = [x for x in mixed_list if isinstance(x, str)]

    # Sort integers and strings separately
    integers.sort()
    strings.sort()

    # Combine sorted integers and strings
    sorted_list = integers + strings

    return sorted_list

# Test data
mixed_list = [5, 2, 'apple', 'banana', 1, 'orange', 4]
expected_output = [1, 2, 4, 5, 'apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Call the function
sorted_list = sort_mixed_list(mixed_list)

# Print the expected output
print("Sorted List:", sorted_list)
