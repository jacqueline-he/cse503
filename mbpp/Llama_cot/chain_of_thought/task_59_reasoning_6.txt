You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the nth octagonal number.
Required function signature:
def is_octagonal(n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. ```python
def nth_octagonal(n):
    # Step 1: Define a helper function to calculate the nth octagonal number
    def octagonal_number(k):
        # Step 2: Calculate the k-th octagonal number using the formula 4k^2 - 2k
        return 4 * k**2 - 2 * k

    # Step 3: Initialize the result variable
    result = 0

    # Step 4: Iterate over k from 1 to n and calculate the nth octagonal number
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        result = octagonal_number(k)

    # Step 5: Return the nth octagonal number
    return result
```
Let's implement the solution using the given function signature. We will start by defining the helper function `octagonal_number(k)` and then use it to find the nth octagonal number. We will also consider edge cases and implement the complete solution inside triple backticks. Please note that we will not include any input() function.

```python
def nth_octagonal(n):
    # Step 1: Define a helper function to calculate the nth octagonal number
    def octagonal_number(k):
        # Step 2: Calculate the k-th octagonal number using the formula 4k^2 - 2k
        return 4 * k**2 - 2 * k

    # Step 3: Check if k is a positive integer
    if not isinstance(k, int) or k <= 0:
        raise ValueError("k must be a positive integer")

    # Step 4: Initialize the result variable
    result = 0

    # Step 5: Iterate over k from 1 to n and calculate the nth octagonal number
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        result = octagonal_number(k)

    # Step 6: Return the nth octagonal number
    return result
