You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to print check if the triangle is equilateral or not.
Required function signature:
def check_equilateral(x,y,z):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I want to see the result of the function call.

```python
def check_equilateral(x, y, z):
```

```python
def check_equilateral(x, y, z):
    # Step 1: Define the condition for an equilateral triangle
    # A triangle is equilateral if all sides are equal
    # We can use the formula for the length of the third side (c)
    # We know that the lengths of two sides are already known
    # So, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the third side
    c = (x**2 + y**2)**0.5 - z
    
    # Step 2: Check if the third side is equal to the other two sides
    # We can use the condition c == x and c == y
    # If both conditions are true, the triangle is equilateral
    return c == x and c == y

# Test the function
print(check_equilateral(3, 4, 5))  # Expected output: True
print(check_equilateral(3, 4, 6))  # Expected output: False
```

```python
# Define the function
def check_equilateral(x, y, z):
    # Step 1: Define the condition for an equilateral triangle
    # A triangle is equilateral if all sides are equal
    # We can use the formula for the length of the third side (c)
    c = (x**2 + y**2)**0.5 - z
    
    # Step 2: Check if the third side is equal to the other two sides
    # We can use the condition c == x and c == y
    # If both conditions are true, the triangle is equilateral
    return c == x and c == y

# Test the function
print(check_equilateral(3, 4, 5))  # Expected output: True
print(check_equilateral(3, 4, 6))  # Expected output: False
