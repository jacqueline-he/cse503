You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find binomial co-efficient.
Required function signature:
def binomial_Coeff(n,k):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will provide the test cases to verify your solution.

```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k):
    if k > n - k:
        return 0
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result = result * (n - i) / (i + 1)
    return result
```

## Step 1: Analyze the problem
The problem asks for the binomial coefficient, which is calculated as `n choose k`, where `n` is the total number of items and `k` is the number of items to choose. In this case, we need to find the binomial coefficient `n choose k`.

## Step 2: Outline the key steps
To calculate the binomial coefficient, we need to:
- Check if `k` is greater than `n - k`. If true, return 0, as the binomial coefficient is not defined for negative numbers or zero.
- Initialize a variable `result` to 1.
- Use a for loop to iterate from `k` down to 1, calculating the binomial coefficient using the formula `result = result * (n - i) / (i + 1)`.
- Return the final value of `result`.

## Step 3: Consider edge cases
We should consider the following edge cases:
- If `k` is greater than `n`, return 0, as the binomial coefficient is not defined.
- If `k` is less than or equal to 0, return 0, as the binomial coefficient is not defined.

## Step 4: Implement the solution
Here is the complete implementation of the function `binomial_Coeff` inside triple backticks:
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n, k):
    if k > n - k:
        return 0
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result = result * (n - i) / (i + 1)
    return result
```
