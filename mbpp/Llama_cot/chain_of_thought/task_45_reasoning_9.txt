You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to find the gcd of the given array elements.
Required function signature:
def find_gcd(x, y):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. ```python
import math
def find_gcd(x, y):
    """
    This function finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers.
    
    Parameters:
    x (int): The first integer.
    y (int): The second integer.
    
    Returns:
    int: The greatest common divisor of x and y.
    """
    
    # Check if y is 0
    if y == 0:
        return x
    
    # Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd
    while y!= 0:
        # Swap x and y
        x, y = y, x % y
    
    # Return the gcd
    return x
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

*   The Euclidean algorithm is a systematic way of finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It works by repeatedly replacing 'a' and 'b' with 'b' and 'a % b' until 'b' is zero. At that point, 'a' is the gcd.
*   We start by checking if 'y' is zero. If it is, then 'x' is the gcd, so we return 'x'.
*   If 'y' is not zero, we swap 'x' and 'y', and then replace 'y' with the remainder of 'x' divided by 'y'. This is the key step in the Euclidean algorithm.
*   We continue this process until 'y' is zero, at which point 'x' is the gcd.

Edge cases to consider:

*   If either 'x' or 'y' is zero, the function should return the other number.
*   If one of 'x' or 'y' is negative and the other is non-negative, the function should return the absolute value of the positive number.
