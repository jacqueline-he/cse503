You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to count the most common words in a dictionary.
Required function signature:
def count_common(words):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I'll provide the test cases.

```python
def count_common(words):
    # Initialize a dictionary with the words as keys
    word_dict = {}
    for word in words:
        word_dict[word] = 0

    # Count the occurrences of each word
    for word in words:
        if word in word_dict:
            word_dict[word] += 1

    # Find the most common word(s)
    max_count = 0
    most_common_words = []
    for word, count in word_dict.items():
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            most_common_words = [word]
        elif count == max_count:
            most_common_words.append(word)

    return most_common_words

# Test cases:
print(count_common(["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "banana", "apple", "banana", "orange", "apple", "orange", "banana"]))  # Expected output: ["banana", "apple"]
print(count_common(["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "banana", "apple", "banana", "orange", "apple", "orange", "banana"]))  # Expected output: ["apple", "banana"]
```

```python
def count_common(words):
    """
