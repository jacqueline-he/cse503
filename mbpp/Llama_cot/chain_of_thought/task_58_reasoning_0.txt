You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.
Required function signature:
def opposite_Signs(x,y):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. ```python
def opposite_Signs(x,y):
    # Step 1: Determine the signs of the two numbers
    sign_x = 'positive' if x > 0 else 'negative'
    sign_y = 'positive' if y > 0 else 'negative'

    # Step 2: Compare the signs of the two numbers
    if sign_x == sign_y:
        return 'No Signs'
    elif sign_x == 'positive' and sign_y == 'negative':
        return 'Opposite Signs'
    else:
        return 'Same Signs'

# Test cases
print(opposite_Signs(5, 3))   # Expected output: Opposite Signs
print(opposite_Signs(-5, 3))  # Expected output: Same Signs
print(opposite_Signs(5, -3))  # Expected output: Same Signs
print(opposite_Signs(-5, -3)) # Expected output: Opposite Signs
```
```python
def opposite_Signs(x,y):
    # Step 1: Determine the signs of the two numbers
    sign_x = 'positive' if x > 0 else 'negative'
    sign_y = 'positive' if y > 0 else 'negative'

    # Step 2: Compare the signs of the two numbers
    if sign_x == sign_y:
        return 'No Signs'
    elif sign_x == 'positive' and sign_y == 'negative':
        return 'Opposite Signs'
    else:
        return 'Same Signs'

# Test cases
print(opposite_Signs(5, 3))   # Expected output: Opposite Signs
print(opposite_Signs(-5, 3))  # Expected output: Same Signs
print(opposite_Signs(5, -3))  # Expected output: Same Signs
print(opposite_Signs(-5, -3)) # Expected output: Opposite Signs
