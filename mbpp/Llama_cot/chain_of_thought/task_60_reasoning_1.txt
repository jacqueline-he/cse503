You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the maximum length of the subsequence with difference between adjacent elements for the given array.
Required function signature:
def max_len_sub( arr, n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Since this is a problem of finding the maximum length of subsequence, we can use dynamic programming.

```python
def max_len_sub(arr, n):
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = arr[0]
    dp[1] = abs(arr[0] - arr[1])
    for i in range(2, n):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]))
    return dp[-1]
```
However, this function is not correct because it calculates the maximum length of the subsequence ending at index i, not the maximum length of the subsequence with difference between adjacent elements.

```python
def max_len_sub(arr, n):
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = 1
        for j in range(1, i):
            if abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) > abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]):
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + 1)
    return dp[-1]
```
The correct solution is to calculate the maximum length of the subsequence with difference between adjacent elements.

```python
def max_len_sub(arr, n):
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = 1
    max_len = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == 1:
            dp[i] = 1
        else:
            dp[i] = 1
            for j in range(1, i):
                if abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) > abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]):
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + 1)
        max_len = max(max_len, dp[i])
    return max_len
```
Here's the implementation of the solution inside triple backticks. This code block is the final answer. Do not modify it in any way. The code block should not include any additional text within the code block.

```python
def max_len_sub(arr, n):
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = 1
    max_len = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == 1:
            dp[i] = 1
        else:
            dp[i] = 1
            for j in range(1, i):
                if abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) > abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]):
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + 1)
        max_len = max(max_len, dp[i])
    return max_len
