You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the division of first even and odd number of a given list.
Required function signature:
def div_even_odd(list1):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will provide the list of numbers once you finish.

**Note: The list of numbers is provided below**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
Step 1: Identify what this problem is asking for.
The problem is asking to find the division of the first even and odd numbers in a given list.

Step 2: Identify the key steps or algorithms needed.
To solve this problem, we need to:
- Iterate through the list to find the first even and odd numbers.
- Calculate the division of the first even and odd numbers.
- Return the result.

Step 3: Identify any edge cases to consider.
- What if the list is empty? In this case, we should return None or a specific value indicating that the list is empty.
- What if the list contains only one element? In this case, we should return a specific value indicating that the list contains only one element.
- What if the list contains only even numbers? In this case, we should return None.
- What if the list contains only odd numbers? In this case, we should return None.

Step 4: Implement the complete solution inside triple backticks.

```python
def div_even_odd(numbers):
    """
    This function calculates the division of the first even and odd numbers in a given list.

    Args:
    numbers (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    float: The division of the first even and odd numbers.
    """
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return None

    # Find the index of the first even number
    even_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(numbers) if x % 2 == 0), None)

    # Check if the list contains only one element
    if even_index is None:
        return None

    # Find the index of the first odd number
    odd_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(numbers) if x % 2!= 0), None)

    # Check if the list contains only even numbers
    if odd_index is None:
        return None

    # Calculate the division
    result = numbers[even_index] / numbers[odd_index]

    return result
```
