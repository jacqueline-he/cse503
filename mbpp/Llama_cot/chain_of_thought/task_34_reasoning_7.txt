You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to find the missing number in a sorted array.
Required function signature:
def find_missing(ar,N):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Note that N is not necessarily a number, but a length of the array.

```python
def find_missing(ar,N):
```

```python
# edge cases
# 1. If the array is empty or contains only one element, the function should return -1.
# 2. If N is less than 0, the function should raise an error.

# 2. Key steps
# 1. Check if the array is empty or contains only one element
# 2. Check if N is less than 0
# 3. Iterate over the array using a for loop
# 4. For each index i in the range of the array length N
# 5. Check if the current element is not equal to the expected value (i.e., the expected value is missing)
# 6. If the current element is not equal to the expected value, return the missing number
```

```python
def find_missing(ar, N):
    # Check if the array is empty or contains only one element
    if len(ar) < 2:
        return -1

    # Check if N is less than 0
    if N < 0:
        raise ValueError("N must be a non-negative integer.")

    # Iterate over the array using a for loop
    for i in range(len(ar)):
        # Check if the current element is not equal to the expected value (i.e., the expected value is missing)
        if ar[i]!= i + 1:
            # Return the missing number
            return i + 1

    # If the loop completes without finding a missing number, return -1
    return -1
```

```python
# Example usage
ar = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
N = 4
print(find_missing(ar, N))  # Output: 4
```

```python
# Example usage
ar = [1, 2, 3, 4]
N = 3
print(find_missing(ar, N))  # Output: 2
```

```python
# Example usage
ar = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
N = 5
print(find_missing(ar, N))  # Output: 4
