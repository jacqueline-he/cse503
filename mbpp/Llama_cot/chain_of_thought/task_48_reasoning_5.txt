You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to set all odd bits of a given number.
Required function signature:
def odd_bit_set_number(n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Don't forget to include the required function signature.

```python
def odd_bit_set_number(n):
```

```python
# Step 1: Define a function to check if a bit is odd
def is_odd_bit(bit):
    return bit % 2!= 0

# Step 2: Initialize the result number
result = 0

# Step 3: Iterate through each bit of the input number
for i in range(31, -1, -1):
    # Step 4: Check if the current bit is odd
    if is_odd_bit(result & (1 << i)):
        # Step 5: Set the odd bit in the result number
        result |= (1 << i)

# Step 6: Return the result number with all odd bits set
return result
```
