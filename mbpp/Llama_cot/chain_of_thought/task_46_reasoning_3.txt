You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to determine whether all the numbers are different from each other are not.
Required function signature:
def test_distinct(data):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def test_distinct(data):
```

```python
# Define the function test_distinct
def test_distinct(data):
    # Step 1: Check if the input data is a list or a single value
    if not isinstance(data, list):
        # If it's not a list, convert it to a list
        data = [data]
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the list to check for duplicates
    for i in range(len(data)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(data)):
            # Step 3: Check if the current pair of elements are equal
            if data[i] == data[j]:
                # If they are equal, return False
                return False
    
    # Step 4: If no duplicates are found, return True
    return True
```

```python
# Test the function
print(test_distinct([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Expected output: True
print(test_distinct([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]))  # Expected output: False
```

```python
# Test the function with edge cases
print(test_distinct([]))  # Expected output: True
print(test_distinct([1]))  # Expected output: False
```

```python
# Test the function with a single element
print(test_distinct(1))  # Expected output: True
```
