You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to find the maximum sum of elements of list in a list of lists.
Required function signature:
def maximum_Sum(list1):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will provide feedback on the correctness and code quality.

```python
def maximum_Sum(list1):
    #... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

```python
def maximum_Sum(list1):
    """
    Find the maximum sum of elements of list in a list of lists.

    Args:
        list1 (list): A list of lists, where each sublist contains integers.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum sum of elements in the sublists.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.
    """
    # Check if the input list is empty
    if not list1:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")

    # Initialize the maximum sum to negative infinity
    max_sum = float('-inf')

    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list
    for sublist in list1:
        # Check if the sublist is empty
        if not sublist:
            continue

        # Calculate the sum of the current sublist
        sublist_sum = sum(sublist)

        # Update the maximum sum if the current sublist sum is larger
        max_sum = max(max_sum, sublist_sum)

    # Return the maximum sum found
    return max_sum
```

Please provide the implementation of the function inside triple backticks, following the required rules. I will then provide feedback on the correctness and code quality.
