You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find m number of multiples of n.
Required function signature:
def multiples_of_num(m,n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Do not include any unnecessary code.

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
```

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
    result = []
    for i in range(m):
        result.append(i)
    return result
```

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
    result = []
    for i in range(m):
        result.append(i * n)
    return result
```

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
    result = []
    for i in range(m):
        result.append(i * n)
    return result
```

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
    return [i * n for i in range(m)]
```

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
    return [i * n for i in range(m)]
```

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
    return [i * n for i in range(m)]
```

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
    result = []
    for i in range(m):
        result.append(i * n)
    return result
```

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
    result = []
    for i in range(m):
        result.append(i * n)
    return result
```

```python
def multiples_of_num(m,n):
    return [i * n for i in range(m)]
```assistant

```python
def multiples_of_num(m, n):
    """
    Returns a list of m multiples of n.

    Args:
        m (int): The number of multiples to generate.
        n (int): The number to multiply by.

    Returns:
        list: A list of m multiples of n.
    """
    return [i * n for i in range(m)]
```

This solution uses list comprehension to generate the list of multiples in a single line of code. It is concise, readable, and efficient, making it suitable for use in production code.
