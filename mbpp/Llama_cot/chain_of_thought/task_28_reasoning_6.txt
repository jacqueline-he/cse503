You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

```python

Step 1: Understand what a binomial coefficient (nCr) is.
The binomial coefficient (nCr) is defined as the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to order. It can be calculated using the formula:
nCr = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k):
    if k > n-k:
        k = n-k
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result = result * (n-i) / (i+1)
    return result
```
Step 2: Consider edge cases.
We need to consider cases where k is 0, k is n, or k is negative. We also need to handle the case where n is 0.

```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k):
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    elif k > n-k:
        k = n-k
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result = result * (n-i) / (i+1)
    return result
```
Step 3: Consider the mathematical reasoning behind the algorithm.
The binomial coefficient can be calculated using the formula:
nCr = n! / (k!(n-k)!)
This can be simplified to:
nCr = (n-k+1)! / ((n-k)!k!)
This can be further simplified to:
nCr = (n+k-1)! / (k!n-k+1)!
This can be simplified to:
nCr = (n+k-1)! / ((n+k-1)k!k!)

```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k):
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    elif k > n-k:
        k = n-k
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result = result * (n-i) / (i+1)
    return result
```
Step 4: Consider the implementation details.
We can use the math library to calculate the factorial. We can also use a while loop to simplify the calculation.

```python
import math

def binomial_Coeff(n,k):
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    elif k > n-k:
        k = n-k
    result = 1
    factorial_n = math.factorial(n)
    while k > 0:
        result = result * (factorial_n) / (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n-k))
        k -= 1
    return result
```
Step 5: Implement the solution in a single code block.

```python
import math

def binomial_Coeff(n,k):
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    elif k > n-k:
        k = n-k
    result = 1
    factorial_n = math.factorial(n)
    while k > 0:
        result = result * (factorial_n) / (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n-k))
        k -= 1
    return result

```python
import math

def binomial_Coeff(n,k):
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    elif k > n-k:
        k = n-k
    result = 1
    factorial_n = math.factorial(n)
    while k > 0:
        result = result * (factorial_n) / (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n-k))
        k -= 1
    return result
```
