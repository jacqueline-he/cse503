You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to extract every first or specified element from a given two-dimensional list.
Required function signature:
def specified_element(nums, N):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks.  I will test it against your solution.

```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
    # Step 1: Determine the size of the input list.
    size = len(nums)
    
    # Step 2: Check if N is a positive integer.
    if not isinstance(N, int) or N <= 0:
        raise ValueError("N must be a positive integer.")
    
    # Step 3: Check if N is within the valid range.
    if N > size:
        raise ValueError("N is out of range.")
    
    # Step 4: Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of elements that meet the condition.
    count = 0
    
    # Step 5: Iterate over the input list and check each element to see if it meets the condition.
    for element in nums:
        if element == N:
            count += 1
        elif element > N:
            break
    
    # Step 6: Return the count of elements that meet the condition.
