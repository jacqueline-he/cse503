You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the last digit when factorial of a divides factorial of b.
Required function signature:
def compute_Last_Digit(A,B):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def compute_Last_Digit(A,B):
    # Edge case: If A is 0 or B is 0, factorial is 1
    if A == 0 or B == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize variables for the results
    last_digit_A = 0
    last_digit_B = 0
    
    # Loop through the possible last digits (0-9)
    for i in range(10):
        # Compute the factorial of A and B
        A_fact = A * (A-1) *... * (A-i)
        B_fact = B * (B-1) *... * (B-i)
        
        # Check if A_fact is divisible by B_fact
        if A_fact % B_fact == 0:
            # Update the last digit of A
            last_digit_A = i
            break
    
    # Return the last digit of A
    return last_digit_A
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

- We start by checking for edge cases where either A or B is 0.
- We initialize two variables, `last_digit_A` and `last_digit_B`, to store the last digits of the factorials of A and B respectively.
- We then loop through all possible last digits (0-9) using a for loop.
- For each last digit `i`, we compute the factorial of A and B by multiplying their respective numbers from 1 to `i`.
- We then check if the factorial of A is divisible by the factorial of B by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, we update the last digit of A to `i` and break out of the loop.
- Finally, we return the last digit of A as the result.

### Key Steps and Algorithms:

- We use the properties of factorials to compute the factorials of A and B.
- We check for divisibility using the modulus operator.
- We update the last digit of A based on the divisibility condition.

### Edge Cases:

- We check for edge cases where A or B is 0.
- We return 0 as the result for these edge cases.

### Complete Solution:

def compute_Last_Digit(A,B):
    # Edge case: If A is 0 or B is 0, factorial is 1
    if A == 0 or B == 0:

    # Initialize variables for the results
    last_digit_A = 0
    last_digit_B = 0
    
    # Loop through the possible last digits (0-9)
    for i in range(10):
        # Compute the factorial of A and B
        A_fact = A * (A-1) *... * (A-i)
        B_fact = B * (B-1) *... * (B-i)
        
        # Check if A_fact is divisible by B_fact
        if A_fact % B_fact == 0:
            # Update the last digit of A
            last_digit_A = i
            break
    
    # Return the last digit of A
    return last_digit_A
