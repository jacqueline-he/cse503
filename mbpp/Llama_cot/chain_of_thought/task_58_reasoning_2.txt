You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.
Required function signature:
def opposite_Signs(x,y):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.

```python
def opposite_Signs(x, y):
    return x!= y and (x < 0 or y < 0)
```

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The problem requires a function that checks whether two given integers have opposite signs. This means we need to determine if the signs of the two numbers are the same or different.

## Step 2: Key Steps and Algorithms
To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

- First, we check if the signs of the two numbers are the same (i.e., both are positive or both are negative).
- If the signs are the same, we return False.
- If the signs are different, we return True.

## Step 3: Edge Cases
We should consider the following edge cases:

- If both numbers are 0, they have the same sign.
- If one number is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs.

## Step 4: Implementing the Solution
Here is the complete implementation of the function in Python:

```python
def opposite_Signs(x, y):
    """
    Checks whether two integers have opposite signs.

    Args:
        x (int): The first integer.
        y (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the signs of the two numbers are opposite, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if both numbers are 0
    if x == 0 and y == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if one number is positive and the other is negative
    return (x > 0 and y < 0) or (x < 0 and y > 0)
```

The final answer is: 
```python
def opposite_Signs(x, y):
    """
    Checks whether two integers have opposite signs.

    Args:
        x (int): The first integer.
        y (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the signs of the two numbers are opposite, False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if both numbers are 0
    if x == 0 and y == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if one number is positive and the other is negative
    return (x > 0 and y < 0) or (x < 0 and y > 0)
```assistant
