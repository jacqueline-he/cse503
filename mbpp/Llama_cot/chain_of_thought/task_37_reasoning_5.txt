You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to sort a given mixed list of integers and strings.
Required function signature:
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I don't know the exact function signature, but I know it should be a Python function that takes a list of mixed integers and strings as input and returns a sorted list.

```python
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):
    # your implementation here
```

```python
mixed_list = [5, 'a', 3, 'b', 2, 1, 4]
```

```python
sorted_list = sort_mixed_list(mixed_list)
print(sorted_list)
```

```python
# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'a', 'b']
```

```python
# Edge case 1: Empty list
mixed_list = []
sorted_list = sort_mixed_list(mixed_list)
print(sorted_list)  # Expected output: []
```

```python
# Edge case 2: List with one element
mixed_list = [5]
sorted_list = sort_mixed_list(mixed_list)
print(sorted_list)  # Expected output: [5]
```


```python
def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of mixed integers and strings as input, 
    and returns a sorted list of integers and strings in ascending order.
    
    The sorting is done based on the integer values. If the integer value 
    is negative, it is placed at the beginning of the list, if it is positive, 
    it is placed at the end, and if it is zero, it is placed at the beginning.
    
    The sorting of strings is done based on the string length. If the string 
    is shorter than the previous string, it is placed at the beginning of the list.
