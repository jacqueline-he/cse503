You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the nth digit in the proper fraction of two given numbers.
Required function signature:


Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. ```python
def nth_digit_proper_fraction(a, b):
    # Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
    import math
    lcm = math.lcm(a, b)
    # Step 2: Calculate the proper fraction
    numerator = lcm // a
    denominator = lcm // b
    # Step 3: Find the nth digit
    if lcm == 1:
        return 0  # Handle division by zero
    else:
        n = lcm // a
        while n > 0:
            n %= b
            if n == 0:
                return n
            n += lcm // a
        return 0  # If no digit is found
```

Let me know if I need to clarify anything!
