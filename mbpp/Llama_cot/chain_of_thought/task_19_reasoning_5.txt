You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
Required function signature:
def test_duplicate(arraynums):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. ```python
def test_duplicate(arraynums):
    seen = set()
    for num in arraynums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
This problem is asking to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. The approach to solve this problem is to iterate over each element in the array and check if it already exists in the `seen` set. If it does, we return `True` as it means we have found a duplicate. If we finish iterating over the entire array without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.

Step-by-step implementation:
```python
def test_duplicate(arraynums):
    seen = set()
    for num in arraynums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```
