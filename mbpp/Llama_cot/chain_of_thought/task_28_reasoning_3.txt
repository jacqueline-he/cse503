You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find binomial co-efficient.
Required function signature:
def binomial_Coeff(n,k):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will be able to test it.

```
def binomial_Coeff(n, k):
    if n < k or k < 0:
        return 0
    elif n == k:
        return 1
    else:
        return (n-1) * binomial_Coeff(n-1, k-1) + binomial_Coeff(n-1, k)
```
However, the function above is not correct. It only calculates binomial coefficient for positive integers. We need to find the binomial coefficient for any positive integer n and any integer k.

3. We need to ensure the function correctly handles negative integers and non-integer inputs.
4. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to build up a table of binomial coefficients, where each entry in the table is the binomial coefficient of n choose k.

Here is the corrected solution:

```
def binomial_Coeff(n, k):
    if n < 0 or k < 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 0 or k == 0 or n == k:
        return 1
    else:
        table = [0] * (n + 1)
        table[0] = 1
        table[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2]
        return table[n]
```
This solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the binomial coefficient efficiently. It initializes a table to store the binomial coefficients, then fills it in iteratively using the recurrence relation. Finally, it returns the binomial coefficient of n choose k.

Here is the complete implementation:

```
def binomial_Coeff(n, k):
    if n < 0 or k < 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 0 or k == 0 or n == k:
        return 1
    else:
        table = [0] * (n + 1)
        table[0] = 1
        table[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2]
        return table[n]
```
```
# Test the function
print(binomial_Coeff(5, 2))  # Output: 10
```
