You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Required function signature:
def remove_Occ(s,ch):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def remove_Occ(s, ch):
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i] == ch:
            i += 1
        else:
            s = s[:i] + s[i+1:]
    return s
```
Step 1: Define the problem clearly
The problem is asking to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

Step 2: Identify the key steps or algorithms needed
The key steps are:
- Find the first occurrence of the character.
- Find the last occurrence of the character.
- Remove the first and last occurrences.

Step 3: Identify any edge cases to consider
- If the character is not found, the function should not raise an error but return the original string.
- If the string is empty, the function should return the original string.

Step 4: Implement the solution
```python
def remove_Occ(s, ch):
    """
    Removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.
        ch (str): The character to remove.

    Returns:
        str: The modified string with the first and last occurrences removed.
    """
    if not s or not ch:  # edge case: empty string
        return s

    first_occurrence_index = s.find(ch)  # find the first occurrence
    last_occurrence_index = s.rfind(ch)  # find the last occurrence

    if first_occurrence_index == -1 or last_occurrence_index == -1:  # edge case: character not found
        return s

    # remove the first and last occurrences
    s = s[:first_occurrence_index] + s[last_occurrence_index + 1:]
    return s
