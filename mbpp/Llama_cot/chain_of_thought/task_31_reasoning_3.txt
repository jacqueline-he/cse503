You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the top k integers that occur most frequently from given lists of sorted and distinct integers using heap queue algorithm.
Required function signature:
def func(nums, k):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure to include the EXACT function signature.

This solution uses the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt. It first checks the length of the input list and sorts it. It then creates a count dictionary to store the frequency of each integer. It uses a max heap to store the integers with the highest frequency. It then pops the top k integers from the max heap and appends them to the result list. If the length of the input list is equal to k, it returns the sorted list of integers. The solution handles edge cases correctly and is efficient. However, it uses a max heap, which is not the most efficient data structure for this problem. A more efficient solution would use a priority queue, such as a binary heap or a max heap, to store the integers with the highest frequency.

import heapq
import collections
