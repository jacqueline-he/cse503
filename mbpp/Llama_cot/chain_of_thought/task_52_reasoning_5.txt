You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to caluclate area of a parallelogram.
Required function signature:
def parallelogram_area(b,h):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def parallelogram_area(b,h):
    return 2 * b * h
```
5. Finally, provide a clear explanation of your solution and its time complexity.

## Step 1: Analyze the problem
The problem is to calculate the area of a parallelogram. The formula for the area of a parallelogram is given by `Area = base * height`, where `base` is the length of the base and `height` is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side.

## Step 2: Outline the key steps
To calculate the area of a parallelogram, we need to:
1. Identify the base and height of the parallelogram.
2. Use the formula `Area = base * height` to calculate the area.

## Step 3: Identify the base and height
The base of the parallelogram is the length of one side, which is given by `b`. The height of the parallelogram is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side, which is given by `h`.

## Step 4: Implement the solution
```python
def parallelogram_area(b, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a parallelogram.

    Args:
        b (float): The length of the base.
        h (float): The perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the parallelogram.
    """
    return 2 * b * h
```
## Step 5: Provide edge cases
We should consider the following edge cases:
- If `b` or `h` is zero, the function should raise an error or return a special value to indicate that the input is invalid.
- If `b` is negative or `h` is negative, the function should raise an error or return a special value to indicate that the input is invalid.

## Step 6: Implement the complete solution
```python
def parallelogram_area(b, h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a parallelogram.

    Args:
        b (float): The length of the base.
        h (float): The perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the parallelogram.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If b or h is zero, or if b is negative and h is positive.
    """
    if b <= 0 or h <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Both base and height must be positive")
    return 2 * b * h
```
## Step 7: Provide a clear explanation of the solution and its time complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it involves a constant number of operations regardless of the input size. The function takes two arguments, `b` and `h`, which are evaluated only once, and then the result is returned. The calculations involved are straightforward and do not depend on the size of the input, making the solution efficient and scalable.
