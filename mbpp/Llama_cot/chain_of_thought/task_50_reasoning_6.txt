You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the list with minimum length using lambda function.
Required function signature:
def min_length_list(input_list):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def min_length_list(input_list):
    return min(input_list)
```
Step 1: Think about the problem.
The problem is asking to find the list with the minimum length from a given list of lists.

Step 2: Identify the key steps or algorithms needed.
To find the minimum length list, we need to iterate over the input list, and for each element, we need to find its corresponding index in the original list. We can then compare the lengths of the sublists to find the minimum length list.

Step 3: Consider edge cases.
We need to consider the case where the input list is empty or contains only one element, as these cases do not have a minimum length.

Step 4: Implement the solution.

```python
def min_length_list(input_list):
    if len(input_list) == 0:
        return "List is empty"
    else:
        min_len_list = min(input_list, key=len)
        return min_len_list
```
This solution uses the built-in `min()` function to find the sublist with the minimum length, and then returns the corresponding list. If the input list is empty, it returns a string indicating that the list is empty. Otherwise, it returns the sublist with the minimum length.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list is a list of lists, where each inner list contains elements of the same type. If the input list is not a list of lists, or if the inner lists contain elements of different types, this solution may not work correctly.
