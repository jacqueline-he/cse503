You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse.
Required function signature:
def rev(num):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def rev(num):
    return 2 * (num + 1) - 1
```
```python
def rev(num):
    return 2 * num - 1
```
```python
def rev(num):
    return num - 1
```
I want to find a number that is one less than twice its reverse. For example, the number 5 is one less than twice its reverse, which is 10, because 10 - 1 = 9.

```python
# Edge case: negative numbers
# The function should not accept negative numbers
def rev(num):
    if num < 0:
        return "Error: Negative numbers are not supported"
    else:
        return 2 * num - 1
```
```python
# Edge case: zero
# The function should return zero
def rev(num):
    if num == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return 2 * num - 1
```
```python
# Edge case: positive numbers
# The function should return the correct result
def rev(num):
    if num > 0:
        return 2 * num - 1
    else:
        return "Error: Positive numbers are not supported"
```
```python
# Edge case: non-numeric inputs
# The function should raise an error
def rev(num):
    if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a number")
```
```python
# Non-numeric input
try:
    rev(5)
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```
```python
# Test case: positive numbers
try:
    rev(10)
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)

```python
# Test case: negative numbers
try:
    rev(-5)
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)

```python
# Test case: zero
try:
    rev(0)
except TypeError as e:
