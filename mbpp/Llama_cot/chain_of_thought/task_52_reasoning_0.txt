You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to caluclate area of a parallelogram.
Required function signature:
def parallelogram_area(b,h):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def parallelogram_area(b,h):
```

```python
    # Step 1: Understand the problem
    # Step 2: Identify the variables and their values
    # Step 3: Calculate the area
    # Step 4: Return the calculated area
```

```python
def parallelogram_area(b,h):
    """
    Calculate the area of a parallelogram.

    Args:
        b (float): The base of the parallelogram.
        h (float): The height of the parallelogram.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the parallelogram.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If either b or h is negative.
    """
    # Step 1: Understand the problem
    # Step 2: Identify the variables and their values
    # Step 3: Calculate the area
    # Step 4: Return the calculated area

    # Step 5: Check for invalid input
    if b < 0 or h < 0:
        raise ValueError("Both base and height must be non-negative.")

    # Step 6: Calculate the area using the formula
    area = b * h
    return area
```

```python
# Test the function with sample inputs
print(parallelogram_area(5, 6))  # Expected output: 30
print(parallelogram_area(0, 5))  # Expected output: ValueError: Both base and height must be non-negative.
```

```python
# Test the function with edge cases
print(parallelogram_area(1, 1))  # Expected output: 1
print(parallelogram_area(-1, 1))  # Expected output: ValueError: Both base and height must be non-negative.
