You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse.
Required function signature:
def rev(num):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Here is the function definition to start with: ```python
def rev(num):
```

```python
def rev(num):
    # Define the function to reverse the number
    reversed_num = int(str(num)[::-1])
    
    # Check if the number is one less than twice its reverse
    if reversed_num == 2 * num - 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

```python
# Test cases to verify the function's correctness
print(rev(13))   # Expected output: True
print(rev(10))   # Expected output: False
print(rev(15))   # Expected output: False
```
