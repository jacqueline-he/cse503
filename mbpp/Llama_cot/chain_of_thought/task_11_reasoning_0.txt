You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Required function signature:
def remove_Occ(s,ch):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. This will ensure the solution is correct and concise.

```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch):
```

```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch):
```

```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch):
```

```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch):
```

```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch):
```

## Step 1: Define the function with the required signature
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch):
```

## Step 2: Initialize an empty list to store the characters
```python
result = []
```

## Step 3: Iterate over the string
```python
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i]!= ch:
        result.append(s[i])
```

## Step 4: Join the characters in the list to form the result string
```python
result_str = ''.join(result)
```

## Step 5: Return the result string
```python
return result_str
```

The final answer is:
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i]!= ch:
            result.append(s[i])
    result_str = ''.join(result)
    return result_str
```
