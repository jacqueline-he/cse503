You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the missing number in a sorted array.
Required function signature:
def find_missing(ar,N):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks.```python
def find_missing(ar, N):
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty set to store the numbers in the array
    num_set = set()
    
    # Step 2: Populate the set with the numbers from the array
    for num in ar:
        num_set.add(num)
        
    # Step 3: Find the missing number by iterating over the set and comparing with the length of the array
    for num in num_set:
        if num not in ar:
            return num
    
    # Step 4: If no missing number is found, return None
    return None
```
Step 5: Write the complete solution using the required function signature.

```python
def find_missing(ar, N):
    num_set = set()
    for num in ar:
        num_set.add(num)
    for num in num_set:
        if num not in ar:
            return num
    return None

This function works by first creating a set from the input array. This set automatically removes any duplicate numbers, which is necessary because the array is sorted. Then, it iterates over the set and checks if each number is in the original array. If it's not, it returns that number as the missing one. If no missing number is found, it returns None. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the array.
