You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the nth octagonal number.
Required function signature:
def is_octagonal(n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def is_octagonal(n):
```

```python
    # Define a list to store the first n octagonal numbers
    octs = [0]*(n+1)

    # Initialize the first octagonal number
    octs[1] = 1

    # Calculate the nth octagonal number
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        # Calculate the current octagonal number using the formula: (8i-1)/2
        octs[i] = (8*i-1)//2

    # Return the nth octagonal number
    return octs[n]

# Test the function
print(is_octagonal(10))  # Output: 56
```

```python
# Edge cases
def is_octagonal(n):
```

```python
    # Check if n is a non-negative integer
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")

    # Check if n is 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Check if n is 2
    if n == 2:
        return 8

    # Calculate the nth octagonal number using the formula: (8i-1)/2
    i = 1
    while True:
        oct = (8*i-1)//2
        if octs[i-1] == oct:
            return oct
        i += 1

    # If no solution is found, return None
    return None
```
