You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Required function signature:


Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I donâ€™t know how to write a function to find the volume of a triangular prism, I am assuming you will guide me through the process.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem
A triangular prism is a three-dimensional solid object with two triangular bases connected by three rectangular sides. The volume of a triangular prism is the sum of the volumes of the two triangular bases and the volume of the rectangular prism that is formed by the three rectangular sides.

## Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem
To find the volume of the triangular prism, we need to follow these steps:
1. Calculate the area of the two triangular bases.
2. Calculate the length and width of the rectangular prism.
3. Calculate the volume of the rectangular prism.
4. Add the volumes of the two triangular bases and the rectangular prism to get the total volume.

## Step 3: Algorithmic Thinking
We can use the following mathematical formulas to solve this problem:
- Area of a triangle: A = (1/2) * base * height
- Volume of a rectangular prism: V = length * width * height

## Step 4: Key Steps
1. Define the function to calculate the area of a triangle.
2. Define the function to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism.
3. Define the function to calculate the volume of the triangular prism.

## Step 5: Edge Cases
We need to consider the following edge cases:
- If the base is a point (i.e., the triangle is degenerate), the volume is 0.
- If the rectangular prism has zero height, the volume is 0.

## Step 6: Implementation
```python
import math

def calculate_area_of_triangle(base, height):
    return (1/2) * base * height

def calculate_volume_of_rectangular_prism(length, width, height):
    return length * width * height

def calculate_volume_of_triangular_prism(base1, base2, height):
    # Calculate the area of the two triangular bases
    area1 = calculate_area_of_triangle(base1, height)
    area2 = calculate_area_of_triangle(base2, height)
    
    # Calculate the volume of the rectangular prism
    volume = length * width * height
    
    # Add the volumes of the two triangular bases and the rectangular prism
    total_volume = area1 + area2 + volume
    
    return total_volume

# Test the function
base1 = 5
base2 = 3
height = 4
print(calculate_volume_of_triangular_prism(base1, base2, height))
```
Note: This is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to solve this problem.
