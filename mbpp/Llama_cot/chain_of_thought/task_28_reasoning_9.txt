You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find binomial co-efficient.
Required function signature:
def binomial_Coeff(n,k):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I'll provide the test cases once I have them.

The binomial coefficient, often referred to as "n choose k", is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n distinct items without regard to the order of selection. The binomial coefficient is denoted by the Greek letter "b" and is calculated using the formula:
nCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

Where:
- n! (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to n.
- k! (k factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to k.
- nCk is the binomial coefficient.

The problem asks us to write a Python function to calculate the binomial coefficient.

Step 1: Understand the problem statement.
Step 2: Identify the key steps or algorithms needed.
Step 3: Consider any edge cases to be aware of.
Step 4: Write the complete solution inside triple backticks.

```python
import math

def binomial_Coeff(n, k):
    # Define the edge cases
    if n < 0 or k < 0:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the binomial coefficient
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    else:
        return math.comb(n, k)
```

This function will return 0 for any negative input, 1 for both 0 and n, and a calculated binomial coefficient for any other positive integer k. The `math.comb` function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient. The `math.factorial` function is used to calculate the factorial of a number. The `if-elif-else` statement is used to handle the edge cases. The `return` statement is used to return the binomial coefficient.
