You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find m number of multiples of n.
Required function signature:
def multiples_of_num(m,n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will give the final answer once I have tested it.

Please provide a clear explanation and the solution. I am ready when you are. Go!

## Step 1: Analyze the problem
This problem is asking to find the m number of multiples of a given number n. In other words, we need to generate a list of m elements where each element is a multiple of n.

## Step 2: Key steps and algorithms
To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates over a range of numbers and checks if each number is a multiple of n. We can use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is a multiple of n.

## Step 3: Edge cases
We need to consider the following edge cases:

- If m is 0, we should return an empty list.
- If n is 0, we should return an empty list.
- If n is 1, we should return [0, 1, 2,... m * n].
- If m is 1 and n is greater than 1, we should return [n, 2n, 3n,... (m * n) * 2].

## Step 4: Implement the solution
Here is the implementation of the solution:
```python
def multiples_of_num(m, n):
    if m == 0 or n == 0:
        return []
    result = []
    for i in range(1, (m * n) + 1):
        if i % n == 0:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```
The final answer is: 
```python
def multiples_of_num(m, n):
    if m == 0 or n == 0:
        return []
    result = []
    for i in range(1, (m * n) + 1):
        if i % n == 0:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```
