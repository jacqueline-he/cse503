You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.
Required function signature:
def opposite_Signs(x,y):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure the function signature is correct.

```python
def opposite_Signs(x,y):
```

```python
def opposite_Signs(x,y):
```

```python
def opposite_Signs(x,y):
```

```python
def opposite_Signs(x,y):
```

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
This problem requires us to determine whether two given integers have opposite signs. This means we need to check if the product of the two numbers is positive or negative.

## Step 2: Identify Key Steps and Algorithms
To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:
1. Multiply the two numbers.
2. Check if the product is positive or negative.
3. If the product is positive, return True; otherwise, return False.

## Step 3: Identify Edge Cases
We should consider the following edge cases:
- Zero numbers: If both numbers are zero, they have opposite signs.
- Negative numbers: If one number is negative and the other is positive, they have opposite signs.
- Positive numbers: If both numbers are positive or both are negative, they have opposite signs.

## Step 4: Implement the Solution
Here is the implementation of the function:
```python
def opposite_Signs(x,y):
    return (x * y) > 0
```

The final answer is: 
```python
def opposite_Signs(x,y):
    return (x * y) > 0
```
