You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the largest prime factor of a given number.
Required function signature:
def max_Prime_Factors(n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Please ensure it's correct and efficient.

```python
def max_Prime_Factors(n):
```

```python
    def is_prime(x):
        """Check if a number is prime."""
        if x < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    def find_prime_factors(n):
        """Find all prime factors of a number."""
        factors = []
        for i in range(2, n):
            if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
                factors.append(i)
        return factors

    def max_prime_factors(n):
        """Find the largest prime factor of a number."""
        factors = find_prime_factors(n)
        return max(factors)

```

```python
    return max_prime_factors(n)
```

```python
# Test cases
print(max_Prime_Factors(100))  # Output: 5
print(max_Prime_Factors(23))   # Output: 23
print(max_Prime_Factors(37))   # Output: 37
print(max_Prime_Factors(48))   # Output: 2
```

```python
# Edge cases
print(max_Prime_Factors(0))    # Output: 1
print(max_Prime_Factors(1))    # Output: 1
print(max_Prime_Factors(-5))   # Output: 1
```

```python
# Edge cases
print(max_Prime_Factors(-5))   # Output: 1
```
