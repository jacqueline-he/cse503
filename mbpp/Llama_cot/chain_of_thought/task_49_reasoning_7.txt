You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to extract every first or specified element from a given two-dimensional list.
Required function signature:
def specified_element(nums, N):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 
```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
```
```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
```
```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
```
```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
```
```
### Step 1: Understand the problem
This problem asks us to extract every first or specified element from a given two-dimensional list.

### Step 2: Identify the key steps or algorithms needed
We need to iterate over each row in the two-dimensional list and then iterate over each element in each row. We can use two nested loops to achieve this.

### Step 3: Consider any edge cases to include
We should consider the case when the input list is empty or contains only one element. In such cases, we should return an empty list or raise an error.

### Step 4: Implement the complete solution
```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
    """
    Extract every first or specified element from a given two-dimensional list.

    Args:
    nums (list): A two-dimensional list of elements.
    N (int): The index of the specified element.

    Returns:
    list: A list of elements at the specified index.
    """
    if not nums or len(nums) == 1:
        return []

    result = []
    for row in nums:
        for elem in row:
            if elem == N:
                result.append(elem)
                break

    return result
