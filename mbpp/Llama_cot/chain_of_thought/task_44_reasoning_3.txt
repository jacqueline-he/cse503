You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function that matches a word at the beginning of a string.
Required function signature:
def text_match_string(text):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will provide the test data once you are ready.

Task Explanation:
This problem is asking for a function that checks if a word is present at the beginning of a given text. It is assumed that the input text will always be a string.

Step 1: Define the function signature with the required parameters.
```python
def text_match_string(text):
```

Step 2: Analyze the input and required output.
```python
text = input("Enter a text: ")
word = input("Enter a word to match: ")
```

Step 3: Implement the solution.
```python
def text_match_string(text):
    # Step 4: Remove leading whitespace from the input text
    text = text.strip()
    
    # Step 5: Check if the word is present at the beginning of the text
    if text.startswith(word):
        # Step 6: Return True if the word is found, False otherwise
        return True
    else:
        # Step 7: Return False if the word is not found
        return False
```

Step 8: Test the function with sample inputs and edge cases.
```python
# Test cases
print(text_match_string("   Hello World!   "))  # Expected output: True
print(text_match_string("Hello World!"))  # Expected output: False
print(text_match_string(""))  # Expected output: False
print(text_match_string("   "))  # Expected output: False
print(text_match_string("   Hello"))  # Expected output: False
```
Step 9: Provide the complete solution.
```python
def text_match_string(text):
    text = text.strip()
    if text.startswith(word):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
