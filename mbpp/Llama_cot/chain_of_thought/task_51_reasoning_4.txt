You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to print check if the triangle is equilateral or not.
Required function signature:
def check_equilateral(x,y,z):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def check_equilateral(x,y,z):
    # Step 1: Check if x equals y
    if x == y:
        # Step 2: Check if x equals z
        if x == z:
            # Step 3: Check if y equals z
            if y == z:
                # Return True, if all conditions are met, print "Equilateral Triangle"
                print("Equilateral Triangle")
            else:
                # Return False, if any condition is not met, print "Not Equilateral"
                print("Not Equilateral")
        else:
            # Return False, if x equals z but x!= y
            print("Not Equilateral")
    else:
        # Return False, if x!= y or x!= z
        print("Not Equilateral")
```

```python
# Edge case: x == y == z
print(check_equilateral(3,3,3)) # Expected output: Equilateral Triangle

# Edge case: x!= y
print(check_equilateral(1,2,3)) # Expected output: Not Equilateral

# Edge case: x!= y!= z
print(check_equilateral(1,2,4)) # Expected output: Not Equilateral
```
```python
# Edge case: x!= y or x!= z
print(check_equilateral(1,2,5)) # Expected output: Not Equilateral
```
