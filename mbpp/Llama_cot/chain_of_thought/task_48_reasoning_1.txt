You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

**Step-by-Step Analysis and Solution**

This problem is asking to set all odd bits of a given number. To solve this, we need to understand how binary representation works. Each bit in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from 2^0 for the rightmost bit.

The key steps in this algorithm are:

1. Initialize a variable `odd` to 0, which will store the odd bits.
2. While `n` is not 0, perform the following steps:
    1. Calculate the bitwise AND of `n` and `n-1` using the `&` operator. This will set all bits that are not set in either `n` or `n-1` to 0.
    2. If the result is not 0, it means that the least significant bit of `n` is set to 1. In this case, set the corresponding bit in `odd` to 1 using the `|` operator.
    3. Right shift `n` by 1 bit using the `>>` operator. This effectively removes the least significant bit from `n`.

**Implementation**

Here is the complete solution inside triple backticks:

```python
def odd_bit_set_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    odd = 0
    while n!= 0:
        n = n & (n - 1)
        if n!= 0:
            odd = odd | (1 << odd)
        n = n >> 1
    return odd
```

This implementation follows the key steps outlined above and uses bitwise operations to efficiently set all odd bits of the input number `n`.
