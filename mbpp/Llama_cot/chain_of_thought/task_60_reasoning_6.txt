You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == 1:
            dp[i] = 1
        else:
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1
    return max(dp)
```
```python
def max_len_sub( arr, n):
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] - arr[i-1] > 1:
            max_len = max(max_len, dp[i-1] + 1)
    return max_len
```
```python
def max_len_sub( arr, n):
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == 1:
            dp[i] = 1
        else:
            dp[i] = 1 if arr[i] - arr[i-1] > 1 else dp[i-1]
    return max(dp)
```
```python
def max_len_sub( arr, n):
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        if i == 2:
            dp[i] = 1
        elif i == 3:
            dp[i] = 2
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + 1
    return max(dp)
```
```python
def max_len_sub( arr, n):
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 2
    for i in range(3, n):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + 1
    return max(dp)

Let's break it down further.

## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the key steps or algorithms needed.

The problem asks for the maximum length of a subsequence with a difference between adjacent elements in an array. We can solve this problem by using dynamic programming.

## Step 2: Consider edge cases and requirements.

The array can have at most `n` elements, and we need to return the maximum length of the subsequence. We also need to handle edge cases such as an empty array or an array with only one element.

## Step 3: Implement the solution using dynamic programming.

We can use a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum length of the subsequence ending at each position in the array. We initialize the first two elements of the `dp` array to 1, since the maximum length of the subsequence ending at an empty array is 1.

## Step 4: Fill in the rest of the `dp` array.

We iterate through the array from the third element to the last element. For each element `i`, we check if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` is greater than 1. If it is, we update the maximum length of the subsequence ending at `i` by taking the maximum of the maximum length of the subsequence ending at `i-1` and the maximum length of the subsequence ending at `i-2` plus 1.

## Step 5: Return the maximum length of the subsequence.

Finally, we return the maximum length of the subsequence, which is stored in the last element of the `dp` array.

## Step 6: Implement the complete solution inside triple backticks.

```python
def max_len_sub( arr, n):
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 2
    for i in range(3, n):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + 1
    return max(dp)
```
