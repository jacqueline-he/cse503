You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a function to print check if the triangle is equilateral or not.
Required function signature:
def check_equilateral(x,y,z):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will provide the test cases once I have it.

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The task is to write a function that checks if a given triangle with sides of lengths x, y, and z is equilateral.

## Step 2: Key steps and algorithms
To determine if a triangle is equilateral, we need to check if the lengths of all sides are equal. If they are, then the triangle is equilateral.

## Step 3: Edge cases to consider
We should consider what happens when x = y = z. In this case, the triangle is actually equilateral, so we should return True.

## Step 4: Implement the solution
```python
def check_equilateral(x, y, z):
    # Check if x = y = z
    if x == y == z:
        return True
    # Check if the triangle is equilateral by checking the lengths of all sides
    elif x + y > z and x + z > y and y + z > x:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The final answer is: ```python
def check_equilateral(x, y, z):
    # Check if x = y = z
    if x == y == z:
        return True
    # Check if the triangle is equilateral by checking the lengths of all sides
    elif x + y > z and x + z > y and y + z > x:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
