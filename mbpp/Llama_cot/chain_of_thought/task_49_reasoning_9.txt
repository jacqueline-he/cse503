You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to extract every first or specified element from a given two-dimensional list.
Required function signature:
def specified_element(nums, N):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will provide the input data once you are ready.

```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
```

Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1.  We are given a two-dimensional list `nums` and an integer `N`.
2.  We need to extract every first or specified element from the list.
3.  There are no specific constraints mentioned about the size of the list.
4.  We need to handle all possible cases, including edge cases.
5.  The function should return a list of extracted elements.

Let's implement the solution:

```python
def specified_element(nums, N):
    """
    Extract every first or specified element from a given two-dimensional list.

    Args:
    nums (list): A two-dimensional list of integers.
    N (int): The specified index of the first element.

    Returns:
    list: A list of extracted elements.
    """
    # Check if N is within the bounds of the list
    if N < 0 or N >= len(nums):
        raise ValueError("N is out of bounds")

    # Extract the specified element
    extracted_elements = [nums[i][N] for i in range(len(nums))]
    
    return extracted_elements
````

This implementation uses list comprehension to extract the specified element from the two-dimensional list. The `range(len(nums))` generates indices for the specified element, and `nums[i][N]` accesses the element at that index. The extracted elements are collected in a list and returned as the result.
