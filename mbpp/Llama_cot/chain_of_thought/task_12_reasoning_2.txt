You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.
Required function signature:
def sort_matrix(M):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I will provide the test cases and the expected output.

```python
def sort_matrix(M):
    return sorted(M, key=sum)
```

```python

    # Edge case: If the input matrix is empty, return it as it is already sorted
    if not M:

    row_sums = [0] * len(M[0])
    # Calculate the sum of each row
    for row in M:
        for num in row:
            row_sums[num-1] += num
    # Sort the matrix based on the row sums
    return [[num, row_sums[num-1]] for num, row in enumerate(M)]
