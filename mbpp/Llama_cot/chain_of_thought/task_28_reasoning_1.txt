You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find binomial co-efficient.
Required function signature:
def binomial_Coeff(n,k):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. ```python
def binomial_Coeff(n, k):
    # Step 1: Check if k is greater than n-k
    if k > n - k:
        return 0

    # Step 2: Initialize the result variable to 1
    result = 1

    # Step 3: Use a loop to calculate the binomial coefficient
    for i in range(k):
        result *= (n - i) / (i + 1)

    return result
```

Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Check if k is greater than n-k

We need to ensure that the value of `k` is not greater than `n-k` because this is a key property of binomial coefficients. If `k` is greater than `n-k`, the binomial coefficient would be negative, which is not a valid result.

### Step 2: Initialize the result variable to 1

We initialize the result variable to 1 because the binomial coefficient is always non-negative. This will be used to store the final result.

### Step 3: Use a loop to calculate the binomial coefficient

We use a loop to calculate the binomial coefficient by multiplying the result variable with `(n - i) / (i + 1)`. This is the formula for calculating binomial coefficients.

### Step 4: Return the result

Finally, we return the calculated binomial coefficient.

### Complete Solution
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n, k):
    # Step 1: Check if k is greater than n-k
    if k > n - k:
        return 0

    # Step 2: Initialize the result variable to 1
    result = 1

    # Step 3: Use a loop to calculate the binomial coefficient
    for i in range(k):
        result *= (n - i) / (i + 1)

    return result
```
