You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to find the product of non-repeated elements in a given array.
Required function signature:
def find_Product(arr,n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. This function will return the product of non-repeated elements in the array.

```python
def find_Product(arr,n):
```

```python
import itertools

def find_product(arr, n):
    # Calculate the product of each subset
    subsets = list(itertools.combinations(arr, n))
    product = 1
    for subset in subsets:
        # Check if the subset has a non-zero length
        if len(subset) > 0:
            # Calculate the product of the subset
            product *= subset[0]
            # Update the product
            for i in range(1, n):
                product *= subset[i]
    return product
```

```python
# Test the function
arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
n = 3
print(find_product(arr, n))  # Output: 120
```
