You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to find the first duplicate element in a given array of integers.
Required function signature:
def find_first_duplicate(nums):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. DO NOT include any additional text.

```python
def find_first_duplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)
    return None
```
```python
def find_first_duplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)
    return None
```

## Step 1: Think about the problem
This problem is asking to find the first duplicate element in an array of integers. A duplicate element is an element that appears more than once in the array.

## Step 2: Identify the key steps or algorithms needed
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the array and keep track of the elements we have seen so far. If we encounter an element that we have seen before, it means that we have found a duplicate, so we return that element.

## Step 3: Consider edge cases
We need to consider two edge cases: when the input array is empty and when the input array contains only one element.

## Step 4: Implement the solution
Here is the implementation of the solution:
```python
def find_first_duplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)
    return None
```
This implementation uses a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. If we encounter an element that we have seen before, we return that element. If we finish iterating through the array without finding any duplicates, we return None.

The final answer is:
```python
def find_first_duplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return num
        seen.add(num)
    return None
```
