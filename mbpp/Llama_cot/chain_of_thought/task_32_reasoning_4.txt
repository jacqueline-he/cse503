You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to find the largest prime factor of a given number.
Required function signature:
def max_Prime_Factors(n):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. Since there's no input, we will assume n = 1000.
```python
def max_Prime_Factors(n):
```

```python
def max_Prime_Factors(n):
    """
    Finds the largest prime factor of a given number.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number for which to find the largest prime factor.

    Returns:
    int: The largest prime factor of n.
    """
    # Step 1: Initialize a list to store prime factors
    prime_factors = [2]
    # Step 2: Iterate from 3 to sqrt(n) and check for divisibility
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        # Step 3: Check if i is a factor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Step 4: If i is a factor, check if it's prime
            while n % i == 0:
                # Step 5: If i is prime, add it to the list of prime factors
                prime_factors.append(i)
            # Step 6: Divide n by i
            n //= i
    # Step 7: If n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2:
        # Step 8: Add n to the list of prime factors
        prime_factors.append(n)
    # Step 9: Return the largest prime factor
    return max(prime_factors)

# Test the function
print(max_Prime_Factors(1000))
```
Please go through the solution step-by-step. I will verify the code and provide feedback before I proceed with the next step.
