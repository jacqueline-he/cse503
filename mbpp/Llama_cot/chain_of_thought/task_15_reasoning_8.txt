You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a function to split a string at lowercase letters.
Required function signature:
def split_lowerstring(text):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I'll provide the test cases.

```python
def split_lowerstring(text):
```
```python
# Step 1: Initialize an empty string to store the result
result = ""

# Step 2: Iterate over each character in the input string
for char in text:
    # Step 3: If the character is a lowercase letter, append it to the result string
    if char.islower():
        result += char
```
```python
# Step 4: Return the result string
return result
```
Let's analyze the problem carefully to ensure we understand the requirements.

This problem is asking for a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string that contains only the lowercase letters from the original input string.

The function should ignore any uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates over each character in the input string and checks if it is a lowercase letter. If it is, we append it to the result string.

Here is the complete solution inside triple backticks:

```python
def split_lowerstring(text):
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ""

    # Step 2: Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in text:
        # Step 3: If the character is a lowercase letter, append it to the result string
        if char.islower():
            result += char

    # Step 4: Return the result string
    return result
```
