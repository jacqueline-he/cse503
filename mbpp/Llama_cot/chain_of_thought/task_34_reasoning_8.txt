You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

User request:
Task:
Write a python function to find the missing number in a sorted array.
Required function signature:
def find_missing(ar,N):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. 

```python
def find_missing(ar, N):
    # Handle edge cases
    if N <= 0 or len(ar)!= N:
        return None

    # Calculate the expected sum of the first N natural numbers
    expected_sum = (N * (N + 1)) // 2

    # Calculate the actual sum of the array elements
    actual_sum = sum(ar)

    # Calculate the missing number
    missing_number = expected_sum - actual_sum

    return missing_number
```
```python
# Test cases
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 5], 4))  # Expected output: 4
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4], 4))  # Expected output: 5
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 5], 6))  # Expected output: 4
```
```python
# Edge cases
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4], 1))  # Expected output: 5
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4], 0))  # Expected output: None
```
```python
# Test edge cases
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4], -1))  # Expected output: None
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4], -2))  # Expected output: 3
````

```python
# Edge cases
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4], -5))  # Expected output: None
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4], -10))  # Expected output: 4
```````

```python
# Test edge cases
print(find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4], -11))  # Expected output: None
