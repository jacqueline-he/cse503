You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

```python

# Test case: all elements same
assert max_len_sub([1, 1, 1, 1], 4) == 4

# Test case: all elements different
assert max_len_sub([1, 2, 3, 4], 4) == 3

# Test case: array with negative numbers
assert max_len_sub([-1, -2, -3, -4], 4) == 4

Let's analyze the problem carefully to ensure we understand the requirements. This problem requires us to find the maximum length of a subsequence with a specific property, where the difference between the adjacent elements in the subsequence is the same.

The key steps in solving this problem are:

*   Initialize two variables, `max_diff` and `max_len`, to keep track of the maximum difference and length of the subsequence found so far.
*   Iterate through the array using two nested loops, `for i in range(n)` and `for j in range(i)`.
*   In each iteration, calculate the absolute difference between the elements at indices `i` and `j`.
*   If the calculated difference is greater than the current `max_diff`, update `max_diff` and reset `max_len` to 1.
*   If the calculated difference is equal to `max_diff`, increment `max_len` by 1.
*   After iterating through the entire array, return the final value of `max_len`.

Now, let's consider some edge cases to ensure the solution is correct and handles all test cases.

*   An empty array: The function should return 0, as there are no subsequences to consider.
*   A single-element array: The function should return 1, as the maximum length of a subsequence with a difference of 0 is 1.
*   A two-element array: The function should return 1, as the maximum length of a subsequence with a difference of 0 is 1.
*   An array with all elements the same: The function should return the length of the subsequence, as all elements are the same.
*   An array with all elements different: The function should return the length of the subsequence with the maximum difference, which is 3 in this case.

Here is the implementation of the function in a single code block:

```python

    """

            if diff > max_diff:
                max_diff = diff
                max_len = 1
