You are a Python code generator who reasons step-by-step.
First, analyze the problem carefully to ensure you understand the requirements.
Second, clearly explain your approach using mathematical reasoning and algorithmic thinking.
Third, outline the key steps in your algorithm before writing any code.
Finally, implement EXACTLY ONE SOLUTION in a SINGLE code block marked with triple backticks.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. NEVER include multiple code blocks - only provide ONE final solution inside triple backticks.
2. ALWAYS use the EXACT function signature provided in the prompt.
3. DO NOT use input() functions - read all data from function parameters.
4. Ensure your solution correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.
5. After reasoning, provide ONLY the implementation without any additional text within the code block.

Task:
Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.
Required function signature:
def opposite_Signs(x,y):

Think step-by-step:
1. What is this problem asking for?
2. What are the key steps or algorithms needed?
3. Are there any edge cases to consider?
4. Implement your complete solution inside triple backticks. I expect a function that takes two integers as input and returns a boolean indicating whether their signs are opposite.

def opposite_Signs(x,y):

```python
# Define the variables

# Calculate the sum and product of the absolute values of x and y

product_abs_x_y = abs(x) * abs(y)

# Check if the signs are opposite
if sum_abs_x_y > 0 and product_abs_x_y < 0:
